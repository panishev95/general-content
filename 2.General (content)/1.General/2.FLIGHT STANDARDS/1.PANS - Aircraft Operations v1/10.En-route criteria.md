### EN-ROUTE CRITERIA

#### 1. General

Procedures developed utilizing en-route criteria assume normal aircraft operations. Any requirements to satisfy Annex 6 aeroplane performance operating limitations must be considered separately by the operator.

Two methods can be used to determine en-route obstacle clearance areas:

- A simplified method, which is the standard method; and
- A refined method, which can be used when the simplified method is too constraining.

#### 2. Obstacle clearance areas

In the simplified method, the obstacle clearance area is divided into a central primary area and two lateral buffer areas. In the refined method, the obstacle clearance area is divided into a central primary area and two lateral secondary areas. The width of the primary area corresponds to 95 per cent probability of containment (2 SD). The total width of the area corresponds to 99.7 per cent probability of containment (3 SD).

**Secondary areas for en-route operations may be reduced** when justified by factors such as:

- Relevant information on flight operational experience;
- Regular flight inspection of facilities to ensure better than standard signals; and/or
- Radar surveillance.

**When track guidance is not provided**, for example, outside the coverage of navigation facilities along the route, the primary area splays at an angle of 15° from its width at the last point where track guidance was available. The width of the buffer area (simplified method) or the secondary area (refined method) is progressively reduced to zero, ending in an area without track guidance where the full minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) is applied.

There is no **maximum area width** for routes within the coverage of the facilities defining the route. Outside the coverage of the facilities defining the route, the area splays at 15°, as specified above, “Area without track guidance”.

#### 3. Charting accuracies

Charting accuracies are taken into account when establishing minimum en-route altitudes by adding both a vertical and a horizontal tolerance to the depicted objects on the chart, as specified in PANS-OPS, Volume II, Part 1, Section 2, Chapter 1, 1.8.

#### 4. Obstacle clearance

The MOC value to be applied in the primary area for the en-route phase of an IFR flight is 300 m (1 000 ft). In mountainous areas, this shall be increased depending on:

| Variation in terrain elevation                  | MOC              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Between 900 m (3 000 ft) and 1 500 m (5 000 ft) | 450 m (1 476 ft) |
| Greater than 1 500 m (5 000 ft)                 | 600 m (1 969 ft) |

The MOC to be applied outside the primary area is as follows:

- Simplified method: in the buffer area, the MOC is equal to half the value of the primary area MOC; and
- Refined method: in the secondary area, the obstacle clearance is reduced linearly from the full clearance at the inner edge to zero at the outer edge.

A minimum altitude is determined and published for each segment of the route.
