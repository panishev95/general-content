### FLIGHT OPERATIONS

#### 1. Operating facilities

The operator shall ensure that a flight will not be commenced unless it has been ascertained by every reasonable means available that the ground and/or water facilities available and directly required on such flight, for the safe operation of the aeroplane and the protection of the passengers, are adequate for the type of operation under which the flight is to be conducted and are adequately operated for this purpose.

*Note — “Reasonable means” in this Standard is intended to denote the use, at the point of departure, of information available to the operator either through official information published by the aeronautical information services or readily obtainable from other sources.*

The operator shall ensure that any inadequacy of facilities observed in the course of operations is reported to the authority responsible for them, without undue delay.

Subject to their published conditions of use, aerodromes and their facilities shall be kept continuously available for flight operations during their published hours of operations, irrespective of weather conditions.

The operator shall, as part of its safety management system, assess the level of rescue and fire fighting service (RFFS) protection available at any aerodrome intended to be specified in the operational flight plan in order to ensure that an acceptable level of protection is available for the aeroplane intended to be used.

*Note.— Annex 19 includes safety management provisions for air operators. Further guidance is contained in the Safety Management Manual (SMM) (Doc 9859).*

Information related to the level of RFFS protection that is deemed acceptable by the operator shall be contained in the operations manual.

*Note 1.— Attachment I contains guidance on assessing an acceptable level of RFFS protection at aerodromes.*

*Note 2.— It is not intended that this guidance limit or regulate the operation of an aerodrome. The assessment performed by the operator does not in any way affect the RFFS requirements of Annex 14, Volume I, for aerodromes.*

#### 2. Operational certification and supervision

The operator shall not engage in commercial air transport operations unless in possession of a valid air operator certificate issued by the State of the Operator.

The air operator certificate shall authorize the operator to conduct commercial air transport operations in accordance with the operations specifications.

*Note— Provisions for the content of the air operator certificate and its associated operations specifications are contained in Operations manual (see below this doc).*

The issue of an air operator certificate by the State of the Operator shall be dependent upon the operator demonstrating an adequate organization, method of control and supervision of flight operations, training programme as well as ground handling and maintenance arrangements consistent with the nature and extent of the operations specified.

##### Operating instructions — general

The operator shall ensure that all operations personnel are properly instructed in their particular duties and responsibilities and the relationship of such duties to the operation as a whole.

An aeroplane shall not be taxied on the movement area of an aerodrome unless the person at the controls:

1. has been duly authorized by the operator or a designated agent;
2. is fully competent to taxi the aeroplane;
3. is qualified to use the radiotelephone; and
4. has received instruction from a competent person in respect of aerodrome layout, routes, signs, marking, lights, air traffic control (ATC) signals and instructions, phraseology and procedures, and is able to conform to the operational standards required for safe aeroplane movement at the aerodrome.

##### In-flight simulation of emergency situations

An operator shall ensure that when passengers or cargo are being carried, no emergency or abnormal situations shall be simulated.

##### Checklists

The checklists shall be used by flight crews prior to, during and after all phases of operations, and in emergency, to ensure compliance with the operating procedures contained in the aircraft operating manual and the aeroplane flight manual or other documents associated with the certificate of airworthiness and otherwise in the operations manual. The design and utilization of checklists shall observe Human Factors principles.

*Note — Guidance material on the application of Human Factors principles can be found in the Human Factors Training Manual (Doc 9683).*

##### Minimum flight altitudes

The operator shall be permitted to establish minimum flight altitudes for those routes flown for which minimum flight altitudes have been established by the State flown over or the responsible State, provided that they shall not be less than those established by that State.

The operator shall specify the method by which it is intended to determine minimum flight altitudes for operations conducted over routes for which minimum flight altitudes have not been established by the State flown over or the responsible State, and shall include this method in the operations manual. The minimum flight altitudes determined in accordance with the above method shall not be lower than specified in Annex 2.

##### Aerodrome operating minima

The State of the Operator shall require that the operator establish aerodrome operating minima for each aero- drome to be used in operations, and shall approve the method of determination of such minima. Such minima shall not be lower than any that may be established for such aerodromes by the State in which the aerodrome is located, except when specifically approved by that State.

*Note.— This Standard does not require the State in which the aerodrome is located to establish aerodrome operating minima.*

The State of the Operator shall require that in establishing the aerodrome operating minima which will apply to any particular operation, full account shall be taken of:

1. the type, performance and handling characteristics of the aeroplane;
2. the composition of the flight crew, their competence and experience;
3. the dimensions and characteristics of the runways which may be selected for use;
4. the adequacy and performance of the available visual and non-visual ground aids;
5. the equipment available on the aeroplane for the purpose of navigation and/or control of the flight path during the approach to landing and the missed approach;
6. the obstacles in the approach and missed approach areas and the obstacle clearance altitude/height for the instru- ment approach procedures;
7. the means used to determine and report meteorological conditions; and
8. the obstacles in the climb-out areas and necessary clearance margins.

*Note.— Guidance on the establishment of aerodrome operating minima is contained in the Manual of All-Weather Operations*

**Instrument approach operations shall be classified** based on the designed lowest operating minima below which an approach operation shall only be continued with the required visual reference as follows:

**a)**  Type A: a minimum descent height or decision height at or above 75 m (250 ft); and

**b)**  Type B: a decision height below 75 m (250 ft). Type B instrument approach operations are categorized as:

- Category I (CAT I): a decision height not lower than 60 m (200 ft) and with either a visibility not less than 800 m or a runway visual range not less than 550 m;
- Category II (CAT II): a decision height lower than 60 m (200 ft) but not lower than 30 m (100 ft) and a runway visual range not less than 300 m;
- Category IIIA (CAT IIIA): a decision height lower than 30 m (100 ft) or no decision height and a runway visual range not less than 175 m;
- Category IIIB (CAT IIIB): a decision height lower than 15 m (50 ft) or no decision height and a runway visual range less than 175 m but not less than 50 m; and
- Category IIIC (CAT IIIC): no decision height and no runway visual range limitations.

*Note 1 — Where decision height (DH) and runway visual range (RVR) fall into different categories of operation, the instrument approach operation would be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the most demanding category (e.g. an operation with a DH in the range of CAT IIIA but with an RVR in the range of CAT IIIB would be considered a CAT IIIB operation or an operation with a DH in the range of CAT II but with an RVR in the range of CAT I would be considered a CAT II operation).*

*Note 2  — The required visual reference means that section of the visual aids or of the approach area which should have been in view for sufficient time for the pilot to have made an assessment of the aircraft position and rate of change of position, in relation to the desired flight path. In the case of a circling approach operation, the required visual reference is the runway environment.*

*Note 3 — Guidance on approach classification as it relates to instrument approach operations, procedures, runways and navigation systems is contained in the Manual of All-Weather Operations (ICAO Doc 9365).*

Category II and Category III instrument approach operations shall not be authorized unless RVR information is provided.

**The operating minima for 2D instrument approach** operations using instrument approach procedures shall be determined by establishing a minimum descent altitude (MDA) or minimum descent height (MDH), minimum visibility and, if necessary, cloud conditions.

*Note — For guidance on applying a continuous descent final approach (CDFA) flight technique on non-precision approach procedures, refer to PANS-OPS (Doc 8168).*

**The operating minima for 3D instrument approach** operations using instrument approach procedures shall be determined by establishing a decision altitude (DA) or decision height (DH) and the minimum visibility or RVR.

##### Crew

*Pilot-in-command*. For each flight, the operator shall designate one pilot to act as pilot-in-command.

For each flight of an aeroplane above 15 000 m (49 000 ft), the operator shall maintain records so that the total cosmic radiation dose received by each crew member over a period of 12 consecutive months can be determined.

*Note — Guidance on the maintenance of cumulative radiation records is given in Circular 126 — Guidance Material on SST Aircraft Operations.*

##### Passengers

The operator shall ensure that passengers are made familiar with the location and use of:

- Eeat belts;
- Emergency exits;
- Life jackets, if the carriage of life jackets is prescribed;
- Oxygen dispensing equipment, if the provision of oxygen for the use of passengers is prescribed; and
- Other emergency equipment provided for individual use, including passenger emergency briefing cards.

The operator shall inform the passengers of the location and general manner of use of the principal emergency equipment carried for collective use.

The operator shall ensure that in an emergency during flight, passengers are instructed in such emergency action as may be appropriate to the circumstances.

The operator shall ensure that, during take-off and landing and whenever considered necessary by reason of turbulence or any emergency occurring during flight, all passengers on board an aeroplane shall be secured in their seats by means of the seat belts or harnesses provided.

#### 3. Flight preparation

​		A flight shall not be commenced until flight preparation forms have been completed certifying that the pilot-in-command is satisfied that:

- the aeroplane is airworthy;
- the instruments and equipment prescribed, for the particular type of operation to be undertaken, are installed and are sufficient for the flight;
- a maintenance release has been issued in respect of the aeroplane;
- the mass of the aeroplane and centre of gravity location are such that the flight can be conducted safely, taking into account the flight conditions expected;
- any load carried is properly distributed and safely secured;
- a check has been completed indicating that the operating limitations can be complied with for the flight to be undertaken; and
- the Standards relating to operational flight planning have been complied with.

Completed flight preparation forms shall be kept by an operator for a period of three months.

##### Operational flight planning

An operational flight plan shall be completed for every intended flight. The operational flight plan shall be approved and signed by the pilot-in-command and, where applicable, signed by the flight operations officer/flight dispatcher, and a copy shall be filed with the operator or a designated agent, or, if these procedures are not possible, it shall be left with the aerodrome authority or on record in a suitable place at the point of departure.

The operations manual must describe the content and use of the operational flight plan.

##### Alternate arodromes

*Take-off alternate aerodrome*

A take-off alternate aerodrome shall be selected and specified in the operational flight plan if either the meteorological conditions at the aerodrome of departure are below the operator’s established aerodrome landing minima for that operation or if it would not be possible to return to the aerodrome of departure for other reasons.

The take-off alternate aerodrome shall be located within the following flight time from the aerodrome of departure:

**a)** For aeroplanes with two engines, one hour of flight time at a one-engine-inoperative cruising speed, determined from the aircraft operating manual, calculated in ISA and still-air conditions using the actual take-off mass; or

**b)** For aeroplanes with three or more engines, two hours of flight time at an all engines operating cruising speed, determined from the aircraft operating manual, calculated in ISA and still-air conditions using the actual take-off mass; or

**c)** For aeroplanes engaged in extended diversion time operations (EDTO) where an alternate aerodrome meeting the distance criteria of a) or b) is not available, the first available alternate aerodrome located within the distance of the operator’s approved maximum diversion time considering the actual take-off mass.

For an aerodrome to be selected as a take-off alternate the available information shall indicate that, at the estimated time of use, the conditions will be at or above the operator’s established aerodrome operating minima for that operation.

*En-route alternate aerodromes*

En-route alternate aerodromes, required for extended range operations by aeroplanes with two turbine power-units, shall be selected and specified in the operational and air traffic services (ATS) flight plans.

*Destination alternate aerodromes*

For a flight to be conducted in accordance with the instrument flight rules, at least one destination alternate aerodrome shall be selected and specified in the operational and ATS flight plans, unless:

- The duration of the flight from the departure aerodrome, or from the point of in-flight re-planning, to the destination aerodrome is such that, taking into account all meteorological conditions and operational information relevant to the flight, at the estimated time of use, a reasonable certainty exists that:

  1)  the approach and landing may be made under visual meteorological conditions; and

  2)  separate runways are usable at the estimated time of use of the destination aerodrome with at least one runway having an operational instrument approach procedure; or

- The aerodrome of intended landing is isolated and there is no suitable destination alternate aerodrome.

*Note 1 — Separate runways are two or more runways at the same aerodrome configured such that if one runway is closed, operations to the other runway(s) can be conducted.*

*Note 2 — Guidance on planning operations to isolated aerodromes is contained in the Flight Planning and Fuel Management (FPFM) Manual (Doc 9976).*

Two destination alternate aerodromes shall be selected and specified in the operational and ATS flight plans when, for the destination aerodrome:

- Meteorological conditions at the estimated time of use will be below the operator’s established aerodrome operating minima for that operation; or
- Meteorological information is not available.

Notwithstanding the provisions above, the State of the Operator may, based on the results of a specific safety risk assessment conducted by the operator which demonstrates how an equivalent level of safety will be maintained, approve operational variations to alternate aerodrome selection criteria. The specific safety risk assessment shall include at least the:

​	a)  capabilities of the operator;

​	b)  overall capability of the aeroplane and its systems;

​	c)  available aerodrome technologies, capabilities and infrastructure;

​	d)  quality and reliability of meteorological information;

​	e)  identified hazards and safety risks associated with each alternate aerodrome variation; and

​	f)  specific mitigation measures.

*Note — Guidance on performing a safety risk assessment and on determining variations, including examples of variations, is contained in the Flight Planning and Fuel Management (FPFM) Manual (Doc 9976) and the Safety Management Manual (SMM) (Doc 9859).*

##### Meteorological conditions

A flight to be conducted in accordance with VFR shall not be commenced unless current meteorological reports or a combination of current reports and forecasts indicate that the meteorological conditions along the route or that part of the route to be flown under VFR will, at the appropriate time, be such as to enable compliance with these rules.

A flight to be conducted in accordance with the instrument flight rules shall not:

**a)** Take off from the departure aerodrome unless the meteorological conditions, at the time of use, are at or above the operator’s established aerodrome operating minima for that operation; and

**b)** Take off or continue beyond the point of in-flight re-planning unless at the aerodrome of intended landing or at each alternate aerodrome to be selected in compliance with the rules above, current meteorological reports or a combination of current reports and forecasts indicate that the meteorological conditions will be, at the estimated time of use, at or above the operator’s established aerodrome operating minima for that operation.

To ensure that an adequate margin of safety is observed in determining whether or not an approach and landing can be safely carried out at each alternate aerodrome, the operator shall specify appropriate incremental values for height of cloud base and visibility, acceptable to the State of the Operator, to be added to the operator’s established aerodrome operating minima.

*Note — Guidance on the selection of these incremental values is contained in the Flight Planning and Fuel Management (FPFM) Manual (Doc 9976).*

The State of the Operator shall approve a margin of time established by the operator for the estimated time of use of an aerodrome.

*Note — Guidance on establishing an appropriate margin of time for the estimated time of use of an aerodrome is contained in the Flight Planning and Fuel Management (FPFM) Manual (Doc 9976).*

A flight to be operated in known or expected icing conditions shall not be commenced unless the aeroplane is certificated and equipped to cope with such conditions.

A flight to be planned or expected to operate in suspected or known ground icing conditions shall not take off unless the aeroplane has been inspected for icing and, if necessary, has been given appropriate de-icing/anti-icing treatment. Accumulation of ice or other naturally occurring contaminants shall be removed so that the aeroplane is kept in an airworthy condition prior to take-off.

*Note — Guidance material is given in the Manual of Aircraft Ground De-icing/Anti-icing Operations (Doc 9640).*
