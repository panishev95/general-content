#### 2.5.1. Low Visibility procedures



#### 2.5.2. Friction coefficient

- Information on braking action will be given in terms of friction numbers (friction coefficients indicated with two digits, 0 and decimal symbol being omitted) when based on measurements. In addition, the kind of measuring device used will be reported. When braking action is estimated, plain language will be used.

| **Measured friction coefficient** | **Estimated braking action** | **Code** |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| 0.40 and above                    | good                         | 5        |
| 0.39-0.36                         | good to medium               | 4        |
| 0.35-0.30                         | medium                       | 3        |
| 0.29-0.26                         | medium to poor               | 2        |
| 0.25 or below                     | poor                         | 1        |
