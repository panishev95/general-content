#### 2.3.1. Coordinate system

- All  published  geographical  coordinates  indicating  latitude  and longitude are expressed in terms of the World Geodetic System -1984 (WGS-84) geodetic reference datum.
- An asterisk (*) will be used to identify  geographical coordinates which have not been published in WGS-84 coordinates and whose accuracy of original field work does not meet the requirements in ICAO Annex 11, Chapter 2 and ICAO Annex 14, Volumes I and  II, Chapter 2. Specifications for determination and reporting of WGS-84 coordinates are given in ICAO Annex 11, Chapter 2 and in ICAO Annex 14, Volumes I and II, Chapter 2.

#### 2.3.2. Time System

- "Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)" is used in the air traffic communication services, air traffic meteorological service and in documents published by the Aeronautical Information Service.
- The beginning of the day is designated as 0000 and 2359 for the end of the day.
- Local time in Austria is the "local mean time" (LMT = UTC +1 HR) or the "legal summer time" (UTC + 2 HR)
- During legal summer time, therefore,  the  operational  hours published  in  the  AIP  in  UTC,  which  remain  unchanged in local time, have to be subtraced by 1 HR: e.g.: LOWS AD 2.3, item 7ATS: 0500 - 2200 to be read as 0400 - 2100 i.e. local time remaining unchanged summer and winter 0600-2300
- Operational hours which are extended or increased during legal summer time are additionally notified to the times published in the AIP.
- In  the  AIP  of  Austria  hours  of  operation  stated  in  brackets are applicable during the legal summer time.
