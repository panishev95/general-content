**Visual Approach Slope Indicator System(VASIS) or Precision approach path indicator (PAPI)**

The visual approach slope indicator system or precision approach path indicator will be operated during daylight hours as well as during night at least 10 minutes prior estimated time of arrival.

**Quality of Course Structure**

This character can have one of the following  values: A, B, C, T, D or E. It indicates the ILS point up to where the course structure meets the specifications given in ICAO Annex 10 except the letter T, which designates the runway threshold. 

**Safety Level**

This digit can have one of the following values: 1, 2, 3 or 4. It describes both the continuity of service level  and the integrity level of the ILS  according to ICAO Annex 10.

*Example:* ILS Class III.E 4 means: ILS facility performance category III, usable up to point “E“ with “safety level 4".

**ILS All-Weather Operations Classifications**

According to the above mentioned ICAO classification, the following All-Weather Operations categories apply to the subsequent airports and runways:

|            | Facility                                                  | ILS classification                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Linz       | ILS-26       OEL                                          | III/E/. *)                                                   |

| Klagenfurt | ILS-28R    OEK                                            | III/E/. *)                                                   |

*ATC applies special safeguards and procedures for Low Visibility Operations that will become effective in  relation to specified weather conditions. These procedures are intended to provide protection for  aircraft operating in low visibility and  to avoid disturbances to the ILS signals.

**Determination and reporting of estimated surface friction**

- The estimated surface friction will be assessed at all Austrian Airports.
- The estimated surface friction assessed will be reported in accordance with the following table:

| Estimated surface friction | Code |
| -------------------------- | ---- |
| good                       | 5    |
| medium to good             | 4    |
| medium                     | 3    |
| medium to poor             | 2    |
| poor                       | 1    |
