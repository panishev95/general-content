#### 3.2.1. Important information

- Unless  considerations aboard the aircraft  dictate  otherwise, and the flight cannot proceed to an aerodrome the crew of the aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference should attempt to continue flying on the assigned track and at the assigned cruising level at least until able to notify an ATS unit or within radar or ADS-B coverage.
- When  an  aircraft subjected to an act of  unlawful interference must depart from its assigned track or its assigned cruising level without being able to make radiotelephony contact with ATS units, the pilot-in-command should, whenever possible:
  - attempt to broadcast warnings on  the VHF operating or emergency frequency and other appropriate frequencies, unless considerations aboard the aircraft  dictate otherwise. Other  equipment such as on-board  transponders, data links, etc., should also be used when it is advantageous to do so and circumstances permit;
  - aircraft shall proceed at a level which differs from the cruising levels normally used for IFR flight in the area:
    - by 300 m (1000 ft) if above FL 410, or 
    - by 150 m (500 ft) if below FL 410.
