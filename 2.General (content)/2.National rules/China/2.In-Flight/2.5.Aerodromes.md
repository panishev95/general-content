#### 2.5.1. Cases of runway closure

In cases where a postponement of clearance operations would involve a definite risk of the situation developing into a crisis, e.g. when a fall in temperature causes water or slush to become solid ice, the snow clearance service is authorized to demand that sections of the movement areas be closed to traffic.
