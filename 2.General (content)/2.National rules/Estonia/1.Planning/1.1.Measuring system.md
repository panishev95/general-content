| Horizontal speed including wind speed                        | Knots (kt)                                              |
| Vertical speed                                               | Feet per minute (ft/min)                                |
| Wind direction for landing and taking off                    | Degrees Magnetic (°)                                    |
| Wind direction except for landing and taking off             | Degrees True (°)                                        |
| Visibility, incl. runway visual range                        | Kilometres or metres (km or m)                          |
| Altimeter setting                                            | Hectopascal (hPa)                                       |
| Temperature                                                  | Degrees Celsius (°)                                     |
