### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    |        QNH         |       Feet        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)   | Flight Level (FL) |

#### 2.2.1. Important information

- QNH reports and temperature information for use in determining adequate terrain clearance are provided in MET broadcasts and are available on request from the ATS units. QNH values are given in hectopascals.

- The **transition altitude** for all aerodromes in Estonia is 5000 ft (1500 m) MSL.

- The **transition level** is based on the local actual QNH value and is determined by the appropriate ATS unit.
