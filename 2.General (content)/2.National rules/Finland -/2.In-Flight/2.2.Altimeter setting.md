### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    |        QNH         |       Feet        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)   | Flight Level (FL) |

#### **2.2.1. Important information**

- The transition altitude for all instrument aerodromes is 1 500 M (5 000 FT).
- The transition altitude for Kirkenes terminal control areas ENKR TMA CENTER and ENKR TMA WEST is 2150 M (7 000 FT).
- The transition level - based on the local actual QNH value - is determined by the appropriate ATS-unit.
- Altimeter setting values are given in hectopascals rounded off downward to the nearest whole hectopascal. On request the values will, however, be provided in tenths for landing.
- On approach and landing QFE will be passed on request only. **Note:** In Finland the aerodrome QFE setting always expresses the atmospheric pressure at aerodrome elevation.
- The lowest usable flight levels are determined separately for those areas, where no transition altitude has been specified.
- Except West of the longitude 22° E the lowest usable flight level shall not be positioned below 1 500 M (5 000 FT) within the Finnish flight information region.
- West of the longitude 22° E, within the responsibility area of ACC Finland sector J, the lowest usable flight level shall not be below the altitude 1 850 M (6 000 FT) MSL.
