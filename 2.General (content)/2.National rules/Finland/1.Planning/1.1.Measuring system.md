| Temporary airspace altitudes, elevations and heights may be presented in metres if required by Traficom decision | Metres                                                       |
| Horizontal speed including wind speed, airspeed, ground speed | Knots                                                        |
| Vertical speed                                               | Feet per minute                                              |
| Wind direction for landing and take-off                      | Degrees magnetic                                             |
| Wind direction except for landing and take-off               | Degrees true                                                 |
| Visibility including runway visual range                     | Metres or kilometres                                         |
| Altimeter setting                                            | Hectopascal                                                  |
| Temperature                                                  | Degrees Celsius                                              |
| Mass                                                         | Kilograms                                                    |
| Time                                                         | HOURS AND MINUTES. THE DAY OF 24 HOURS BEGINNING AT MIDNIGHT 0000 UTC. |
