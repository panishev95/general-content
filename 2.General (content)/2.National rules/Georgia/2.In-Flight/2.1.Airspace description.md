### 	2.1. Airspace description

| RVSM Airspace | Airspace classes |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| FL290 - FL410 |       C, G       |

#### 2.1.1. RVSM airspace

The airspace within Tbilisi FIR between FL 290 and FL 410 inclusive is EUR RVSM airspace. Within this airspace,the vertical separation minimum shall be:

- 1000 feet (300 meters) between RVSM approved aircraft;
- 2000 feet (300 meters) in the following cases:
  - between non-RVSM approved State aircraft and any other aircraft operating within EUR RVSM airspace;
  - between formation flights of State aircraft and any other aircraft operating within EUR RVSM airspace; and
  - an aircraft experiencing a communications failure in flight and any other aircraft, when both aircraft are operating within the EUR RVSM airspace

#### 2.1.2. Free Route Airspace

- FRA is available H24 from FL195to FL660 in the airspace encompassed by the lateral limits of Tbilisi FIR.

- FRASC encompasses the FRAs within Tbilisi FIR and Yerevan FIR. For Cross-Border operations planning within FRASC see item.

- Flights arriving to or departing from local airports (UG**) are not free route eligible flights and will follow the standard ATS route network only.

- Flights within FRASC shall be planned outside active Prohibited areas as published in AIP Georgia using valid FRA Intermediate points. Tactical radar vectoring might be applied in order to ensure additional safety margin from temporarily active Restricted areas. The expected route extension in these cases is 10NMor less.

- For speed or flight level change inside FRASC,on FPL Item 15, operators shall use only the FRA Intermediate points. There is no restriction on the number of FRA intermediate points used within FRASC.

  **Direction of Cruising levels within Tbilisi FIR and FRASC**

| FLs over FRA exit point | FLs inside FRA                                           | FLs over FRA entry point |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| EVEN                    | EVEN FLs for all DCT segments                            | EVEN                     |
| ODD                     | ODD FLs for all DCT segments                             | ODD                      |
| ODD                     | A change from EVEN to ODD FLs must be planned inside FRA | EVEN                     |
| EVEN                    | A change from ODD to EVEN FLs must be planned inside FRA | ODD                      |
