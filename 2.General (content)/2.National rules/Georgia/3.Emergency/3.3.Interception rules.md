### 3.3. **Interception rules**

- Principles to be observed by Georgia:
  - Interception of civil aircraft will be undertaken only as last resort;
  -  If undertaken, an interception will be limited to determining the identity of the aircraft, unless it is necessary to return the aircraft to its planned track, direct it beyond the boundaries of Georgian airspace, guide it away from a prohibited,restricted,or danger area or instruct it to effect a landing at a designated aerodrome;
  - Practice interception of civil aircraft will not be undertaken;
  - Navigational guidance and related information will be given to an intercepted aircraft by radiotelephony, whenever radio contact can be established;and
  - In the case where an intercepted civil aircraft is required o land in the territory overflow, the aerodrome designated for the landing is to be suitable for the safe landing of the aircraft type concerned.

- An aircraft which is intercepted by another aircraft shall immediately:
  - follow the instructions given by the intercepting aircraft, interpreting and responding to visual signals in accordance with the specifications in Appendix 1 of ICAO Annex 2;
  - notify, if possible, the appropriate air traffic services unit;
  - attempt to establish radiocommunication with the intercepting aircraft or with the appropriate intercept control unit, by making a general call on the emergency frequency 121.500 MHZ giving the identity of the intercepted aircraft and the nature of the flight;
  - if equipped with SSR transponder, select Mode A, Code 7700, unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate air traffic services unit.
- If any instructions received by radio from any sources conflict with those given by the intercepting aircraft by visual signals,the intercepted aircraft shall request immediate clarification while continuing  to comply with the visual instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.
- If any instructions received by radio from any sources conflict with those given by the intercepting aircraft by radio, the intercepted aircraft shall request immediate clarification while continuing to comply with the radio instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.
- If radio contact is established during interception but communication in a common language is not possible, attempts shall be made to convey instructions, acknowledgement of instructions and essential information by using the phrases and pronunciations in the following table, transmitting each phrase twice:
