#### 2.3.1. Coordinate system

The published geographical coordinates indicating latitude and longitude are expressed in terms of the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84) geodetic reference datum.

#### 2.3.2. Important information

- On some airports Germany accepts short deviations from the localizer course structure requirements due to aircraft penetrating the localizer critical area while vacating the runway.

- When weather conditions permit (visibility not less than 1.500 m, ceiling above 300 ft), Germany accepts deviations from the localizer course structure requirements within the last 2 NM to threshold.

- When weather conditions permit (visibility not less than 1.500 m, ceiling above 300 ft), Germany accepts deviations from the glide path structure requirements within the last 2 NM to threshold.
