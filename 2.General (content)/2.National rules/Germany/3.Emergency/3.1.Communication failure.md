#### 3.1.1. Flights in instrument meteorological conditions

If the flight is conducted under instrument flight rules in instrument meteorological conditions and the radio communication failure occurs, the pilot shall:

1. Set the transponder code to Mode A 7600; and

2. Maintain the last assigned speed and level or the minimum IFR cruising level for a period of 7 minutes. If the minimum IFR cruising level is higher than the last assigned level, the pilot shall climb to the minimum IFR cruising level. The period of 7 minutes commences:

   a) when the last assigned level or minimum IFR cruising level is reached; or

   b) when the transponder code is set to Mode A 7600; whichever is later;

3. After a period of 7 minutes, adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan;

4. When being radar vectored or proceeding offset using RNAV without a temporal or local clearance limit, proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin the current flight plan route no later than at the next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum IFR cruising level.

5. Proceed according to the current flight plan route to an appropriate initial approach fix serving the destination aerodrome and

   a) hold over this initial approach fix until, or as close as possible to, the expected approach time last received and acknowledged;or

   b) if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, hold until or as close as possible to the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan before commencing descent.

6. Conduct an instrument approach procedure established for the initial approach fix; and land, if possible, within 30 minutes:

   a) of the time of arrival last received and acknowledged; or

   b) of the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan, whichever is later.

7. Fly to the alternate aerodrome if a landing is not possible.
