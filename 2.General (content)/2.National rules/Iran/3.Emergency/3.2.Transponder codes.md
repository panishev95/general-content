### 3.2. **Emergency transponder codes**

|             Case             | SSR transponder code |
| :--------------------------: | :------------------: |
|          Emergency           |         7700         |
| Radio communications failure |         7600         |
|    Unlawful interference     |     Mode A 7500      |

-  All aircraft flying within Tehran FIR are required to be equipped with SSR transponder having a combined Mode A/3, 4096 Codes capability and a Mode C automated altitude reporting capability.

- The use of SSR transponder is mandatory for all aircraft flying:

  -  within class A airspace; 
  - within class D airspace in airways; 
  - within class C airspace in Esfahan, Mashhad Shiraz, Bandar Abbas and Tehran TMA; 
  -  within class D airspace in Esfahan, Mashhad, Shiraz and Tehran CTR. 

  *Aircraft which is not equipped with SSR transponder is not permitted to operate within the above mentioned areas.*

#### 3.2.1. Unlawful interference

- Unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise, the pilot-in-command should attempt to continue flying on the assigned track and at the assigned cruising level at least until able to notify an ATS unit or within radar coverage.
- When an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference must depart from its assigned track or its assigned cruising level without being able to make radiotelephony contact with ATS, the pilot-in-command should, whenever possible: 
  - attempt to broadcast warnings on the VHF emergency frequency and other appropriate frequencies, unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise. Other equipment such as on-board transponders, data links, etc. should also be used when it is advantageous to do so and circumstances permit; and 
  - proceed at a level which differs from the cruising levels normally used for IFR flight in the area by 1000 FT if above FL 410 or by 500 FT if below FL 410
