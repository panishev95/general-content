| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Distances (long, in excess of 4000 m)          | Nautical miles, NM                 |
| Distances (short, equal or less than 4000 m)   | Metres, m                          |
| Altitudes, elevations and heights              | Foot/metre, ft/m                   |
| Airspeed*, ground speed, wind speed            | Knot, kt                           |
| Vertical speed                                 | Feet per minute, ft/min            |
| Wind direction for landing and take-off        | Degrees magnetic, °                |
| Wind direction except for landing and take-off | Degrees true, °                    |
| Visibility **                                  | Kilometres, km                     |
| Altimeter setting                              | Hectopascals, hPa                  |
| Temperature                                    | Degrees Celsius, °C                |
| Mass                                           | Kilograms, kg                      |
| Time                                           | second/minute/hour/day,  s/min/h/d |
| Time                                           | week, month, year                  |

*Airspeed is sometimes reported inflight operations in terms of the ratio MACH number

**Visibility of less than 5 km is given in Metres
