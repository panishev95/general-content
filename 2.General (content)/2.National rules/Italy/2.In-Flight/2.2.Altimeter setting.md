### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure  |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    | QNH, QFE on request |   Feet, meters    |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)    | Flight Level (FL) |

#### **2.2.1. Important information**

- The QFE altimeter setting is passed on pilot's request.
- A transition altitude of each aerodrome open to IFR traffic is depicted in the relevant charts.
- Transition level to be used is determined for each aerodrome  on  the  basis  of  the  local  QNH  of  the time and is normally passed on to aircraft with the approach  and  landing  clearances  issued  by  ATC units.

- The vertical position of aircraft when at or below transition  altitude  shall  be  expressed  in  terms  of altitudes,  whereas  such  position  at  or  above  the transition level shall be expressed in terms of flight levels.  While  passing  through  the  transition  layer,vertical  position  shall  be  expressed  in  terms  of flight  levels  when  ascending  and  in  terms  of altitude when descending.
