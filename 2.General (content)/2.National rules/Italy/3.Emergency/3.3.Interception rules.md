### 3.3. **Interception rules**

- In  the  development of regulations and administrative directives for the interception of civil aircraft, the relevant military  authority has given due regard to the following principles:
  - interception will be undertaken whenever deemed necessary, and it might take place, among others,in case of lack of diplomatic clearance to overfly, or land on, the Italian territory, of non-authorized deviations  from  the  cleared  route and of non-compliance with radiotelephony procedures, as well as in particularly serious situations.
  - if undertaken, an interception will be limited to determining the identity of the aircraft, unless it is necessary:
    1. to return the aircraft to its planned track;
    2. direct it beyond the boundaries of national airspace;
    3. guide it away from a prohibited, restricted or danger area;
    4. instruct it to land at a designated aerodrome;
  - practice  interception of civil aircraft will not  be undertaken; 
  - navigational  guidance and related information will be given to an intercepted aircraft by   radiotelephony, whenever radio contact can be established;
  - in  the case where an intercepted civil aircraft is required to land in the territory overflown, the aerodrome designated for the landing is to be suitable for the safe landing of the aircraft type concerned.
- An aircraft which is intercepted by another aircraft shall immediately:
  - follow the instruction given by intercepting aircraft, interpreting and responding  to visual signals;
  - notify, if possible,  the appropriate Air Traffic Services Unit;
  - attempt to establish radiocommunication  with the intercepting aircraft or with the appropriate Intercept Control Unit, by making a general call on the emergency frequency 121.5 MHz, giving  the identity of the intercepted aircraft and the nature of the  flight, and if no contact has been  established, and if practicable, repeating this call on the emergency frequency 243 MHz.
  - if equipped with SSR transponder, select Mode A,Code 7700, unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate Air Traffic Services Unit.

- If instructions received by radio from any source conflict with those given by the intercepting  aircraft  by  visual signals, the intercepted aircraft shall request immediate clarification while continuing to comply with the visual instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.

- If instructions received by radio from any source conflict with those given by the intercepting aircraft by radio, the intercepted aircraft shall request immediate clarification while continuing to comply with  the radio instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.
