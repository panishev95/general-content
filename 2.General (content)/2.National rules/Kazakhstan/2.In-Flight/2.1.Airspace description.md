### 	2.1. Airspace description

| RVSM Airspace | Airspace classes |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| FL290 - FL410 |       C, G       |

#### 2.1.1. RVSM airspace

During IFR flights the following minimum vertical separation intervals shall be applied:

- below flight levels FL290 (8850 m) - 300 m (1000 feet);
- between flight levels FL290 (8850 m) and FL410 (12500 m):
  - 300 m (1000 feet) - between aircraft that admitted to RVSM flights;
  - 600 m (2000 feet):
    - between State aircraft that not admitted to RVSM flights and other aircraft performing flights in the RVSM airspace;
    - between all State aircraft performing a group flight in the RVSM airspace and other aircraft;
    - between aircraft that not admitted to RVSM flights during the transition from / to RVSM airspace, and any other aircraft;
    - between aircraft performing the flight with communication failure, and any other aircraft, when both aircraft are performing the flight in the RVSM airspace;
- above flight level FL 410 (12500 m) - 600 m (2000 feet).


#### 2.1.2. Airspace classes

- The airspace of the Republic of Kazakhstan is classified as follows:
  - Airspace from the common transition altitude 10000 feet (3050 meters) (excluding) to FL510, as well as airspace of TMA, CTR and ATZ of controlled aerodromes is classified as class C airspace;
  - Airspace from the common transition altitude 10000 feet (from minimal altitude in areas with terrain higher than common transition altitude) (including) and below, as well as airspace above FL510 (excluding) is classified as class G airspace;
  - The airspace of UAP is not classified;
  - The airspace of UAR and UAD, if there are no operations, is classified as an airspace class outside these areas.
