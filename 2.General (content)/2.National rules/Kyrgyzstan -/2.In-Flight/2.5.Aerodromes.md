#### 2.5.1. Low Visibility procedures

- The Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) are applied at aerodromes for safety provision of CAT II, III operations and take-off in low visibility conditions. LVP may become effective when ceiling value is 100 m and its further lowering is expected or when RWY visual range (RVR) value decreases less than 1200 m and its further decrease is expected. As a rule, LVP are applied when ceiling value is 60 m and RVR value is less than 600 m. Take-off in low visibility conditions is approved when RVR value is less than 400 m.

#### 2.5.2. Friction coefficient

- Braking action will be measured on every third of runway, 5 to 10 metres on either side of the centre line. The amount of measurements on each part is not less than 8.
- The RWY is considered technically unusable and must be closed for cleaning with a measured friction coefficient below 0.18.

- The information about the friction to the RWY is transmitted through the ATIS message in the form of an estimated friction on the surface (braking action) determined from the value of the measured friction coefficient, Î¼.
- The ratio between the measured friction coefficients, braking action and the operating values are given in the following table:

| **Code** | Measured friction coefficient | Estimated surface friction (braking action) | **Operational characteristic**                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5        | 0.40 and above                | good                                        | Aircraft can be expected to land without undue directional control problems |
| 4        | 0.39-0.36                     | meduim to good                              | Aircraft can be expected to land without undue directional control problems |
| 3        | 0.35-0.30                     | medium                                      | Directional control might be impaired                        |

| 9        | 0.17 and below                | unreliable                                  | Directional control is not monitored                         |
