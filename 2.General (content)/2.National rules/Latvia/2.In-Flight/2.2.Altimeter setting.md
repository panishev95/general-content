### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    |        QNH         |       Feet        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)   | Flight Level (FL) |

#### 2.2.1. Important information

- QNH reports and temperature information for use in determining adequate terrain clearance are provided in MET broadcasts and are available on request from the ATS units. QNH values are given in hectopascal.
- The transition altitude for all aerodromes in Latvia is 5000 ft (1500 m) MSL.

- The transition level shall be located at least 1000 ft (300 m) above the transition altitude to permit the transition altitude and the transition level to be used concurrently in cruising flight, with vertical separation ensured.

- Vertical positioning of aircraft when at or below the transition altitude is expressed in terms of altitude, whereas such positioning at or above the transition level is expressed in terms of flight levels. While passing through the transition layer, vertical positioning is expressed in terms of altitude when descending and in terms of flight levels when climbing.
