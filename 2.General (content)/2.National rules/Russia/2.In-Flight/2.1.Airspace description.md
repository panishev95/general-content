### 	2.1. Airspace description

| RVSM Airspace | Airspace classes |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| FL290 - FL410 |     A, C, G      |

#### 2.1.1. RVSM airspace

The RVSM vertical separation intervals are used in the airspace between FL290 and FL410. 

The airspace of the Russian Federation is divided into the lower and upper airspace and is controlled. The limit of the lower and upper airspace is FL265 (flight level 8100 m), which relates to the lower airspace.

#### 2.1.2. Airspace classes

The airspace over the territory of the Russian Federation and also outside the territory of the Russian Federation, where the responsibility for the air traffic management is placed on the Russian Federation, is classified into airspace classes A, C, G.

The following classes are established in the airspace over the territory of the Russian Federation: 

- class A - in the upper airspace (above flight level 265 (8100 m), where the air traffic control service is provided or the control over the aircraft flights is carried out.
- class C - in the lower airspace (from flight level 265 (8100 m) or below), where the air traffic control service is provided or the control over the aircraft flights is carried out. 
- class G - in the airspace, where class A and class C are not established.

The following classes are established in the airspace outside the territory of the Russian Federation, where the responsibility for the organization of the air traffic is placed on the Russian Federation: 

- class A - in the airspace designated for the airways and RNAV routes. 
- class G - in the airspace, where class A is not established and where flight information service of the air traffic and alerting service are provided. 

#### 2.1.3. Table of cruising levels

Vertical separation shall be carried out according to the semicircular system.
