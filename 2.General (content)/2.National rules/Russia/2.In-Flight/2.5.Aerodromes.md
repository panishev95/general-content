#### 2.5.1. Low visibility procedures

The Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) are applied at aerodromes for safety provision of CAT II, III operations and take-off in low visibility conditions. 

ATS unit shall implement provisions (service procedures in low visibility conditions) concerning the start and continuation of CAT II/III operations and also departures under RVR below 550 m.

Categories of precision approach and landing operations: 

- Category I (CAT I) operation â€“ A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height not lower than 60 m and with either a visibility not less than 800 m or a runway visual range not less than 550 m. 
- Category II (CAT II) operation - A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height lower than 60 m, but not lower than 30 m, and a runway visual range not less than 300 m. 
- Category IIIA (CAT IIIA) operation - A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height lower than 30 m or no decision height, and a runway visual range not less than 175 m. 

#### 2.5.2. Breaking action

RWY will be closed for ACFT operations when the value of the normative friction coefficient is below 0.3. 

**Note:** The value of the normative friction coefficient of 0.3 corresponds to the value of the measured friction coefficient of 0.17.

| Measured friction coefficient by SFT | 0.15 | 0.2  | 0.25 | 0.3  | 0.35 | 0.4  | 0.45 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Normative friction coefficient       | 0.29 | 0.32 | 0.34 | 0.37 | 0.39 | 0.42 | 0.45 |
