| Vertical speed                                               | Feet per minute * (ft/min)                                   |
| Wind direction for landing and taking off                    | Degrees Magnetic                                             |
| Wind direction except for landing and taking off             | Degrees True                                                 |
| Visibility including runway visual range                     | Kilometres or Metres                                         |
| Altimeter setting, atmospheric pressure                      | Hectopascal                                                  |
| Temperature                                                  | Degrees Celsius                                              |
| Weight, Mass                                                 | Metric tonnes or Kilogrammes (t, kg)                         |
| Time                                                         | Hours, minutes and seconds; the day of 24 hours beginning at midnight UTC |
| Volume, tank capacity                                        | Litres                                                       |
