#### 3.2.1. Unlawful Interference

- An aircraft which is being subjected to unlawful interference shall endeavour to set the transponder to Code 7500 and notify the appropriate ATS unit of any significant circumstances associated  therewith  and  any  deviation from the  current flight  plan necessitated by the circumstances,  in  order  to  enable the ATS unit to give priority to the aircraft and to minimise conflict  with other aircraft.
- If an aircraft is subjected to unlawful interference, the pilot-in-command shall attempt to land as soon as practicable at the nearest suitable aerodrome or at a dedicated aerodrome assigned by the  competent  authority, unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise.
- When an occurrence of unlawful interference with an aircraft takes place or is suspected, air traffic services units shall attend promptly to requests by the aircraft. Information pertinent to the safe  conduct of  the  flight  shall continue to be transmitted and necessary action shall be taken  to  expedite the conduct of all phases of the flight, especially the safe landing of the aircraft.
- When an occurrence of unlawful interference with an aircraft takes place or is suspected, ATS units shall, in accordance with locally agreed procedures, immediately inform the appropriate authority designated by the State and exchange necessary information with the aircraft operator or its designated representative.
