#### **2.2.1. Important information**

- Transition altitude at Spanish aerodromes is established at 6000 ft, except: 
- Andorra-La Seu D’Urgell where it is 8000 ft. 
  - Granada/Federico García Lorca.Granada-Jaén where it is 7000 ft. 
- Madrid/Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas, Madrid/Getafe, Madrid/Cuatro Vientos and Madrid/Torrejón where it is 13000 ft
- Flight level zero is located at the atmospheric pressure level 1013.2 HPa (29.92 inches). Consecutive flight levels are separated by a pressure interval corresponding to 500 ft (152.4 m) in the standard atmosphere.
- The QFE reference shall be provided on request, as shown below: 
  - The respective threshold elevation for precision approaches (ILS or PAR/GCA). 
  - The respective threshold elevation for instrument approaches (non-precision approaches) when the mentioned threshold has an elevation of two metres less than the aerodrome elevation, or below. 
  - The aerodrome elevation in any other cases.
