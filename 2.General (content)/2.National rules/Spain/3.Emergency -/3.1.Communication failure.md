#### 3.1.1. Important information

An aircraft on an IFR controlled flight with communications failure, operating in instrument meteorological conditions or when conditions are such that it does not appear feasible to complete the flight shall:

**In MADRID and BARCELONA FIR/UIR** 

1. set transponder to work in Code 7600; 
2. maintain for a period of 7 minutes the last assigned speed and level, or the minimum flight altitude if this is higher than the last assigned level. The period of 7 minutes commences at the time: 
   - the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached, or 
   - the transponder is set to work in Code 7600, or 
   - the aircraft fails to report position passing over a compulsory reporting point, whichever is the latest; thereafter, adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan, which is the flight plan as filed in an ATS unit by the pilot or a designated representative, without any subsequent changes.
3. when being radar vectored or having been directed by ATC to proceed offset using RNAV without a specified limit, rejoin the current flight plan route at the next significant point, at the very latest, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude; 
4. proceed according to the current flight plan route up to the appropriate designated navigation aid or reference fix serving the destination aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with the requirements indicated in 5) below, hold over this aid or reference fix until commencement of descent; 
5. commence descent from the navigation aid or reference fix specified in 4) at the last expected approach time received and acknowledged, or as close as possible to this time; or if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, commence descent at the estimated time of arrival as stated in the current flight plan, or as close as possible to this time; 
6. accomplish a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid or reference fix; and 
7. land, if possible, within the next 30 minutes after the estimated time of arrival specified in 
8. or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later

**In CANARIAS FIR/UIR**

Within Canarias TMA, proceed as described in the previous point.

Outside Canarias TMA: 

1. set transponder to work in Code 7600; 
2. unless otherwise prescribed on the basis of a regional air navigation agreement, maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 20 minutes from the time the aircraft fails to report its position when passing over a compulsory reporting point and, after this period of 20 minutes has passed, adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan; 
3. proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid or reference fix serving the destination aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with the requirements indicated in 4) below, hold over this aid or reference fix until commencement of descent; 
4. commence descent from the navigation aid or reference fix specified in 3) above at the last expected approach time received and acknowledged, or as close as possible to this time; or if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, commence descent at the estimated time of arrival as stated in the current flight plan or as close as possible to this time; 
5. accomplish a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid or reference fix; and 
6. land, if possible, within the next 30 minutes after the estimated time of arrival specified in 4) or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later.
