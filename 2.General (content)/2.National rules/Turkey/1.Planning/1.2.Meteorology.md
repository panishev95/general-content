- thunderstorm
- hail
- heavy rime deposit
- heavy snow
- freezing precipitation

- squall (The warning is designated as “storm” warning and will be issued when the mean speed of the surface wind is expected to exceed 34 KT or when gusts in excess of 41 KT are expected to occur.)
- frost  (A  “frost”  warning  will  be  issued  when  the  air temperature  is  expected  to  fall  below  0°C  on  those dates when protective measures have generally not yet been  taken  and  also  when  a  substantial  deposit  of hoarfrost, e.g wing surface is expected)

- tropical cyclone
- sandstorm/testosterone
- rising sand or dust
- blowing snow
- strong surface wind and gust (‘Strong surface wind”warning will be issued when the speed of surface wind is expected to exceed 20 KT or when gusts in excess of30 KT are expected to occur (National regulation)

The warnings are generally issued in English and are distributed  in  accordance  with  a  distribution  in accordance  with  a  distribution  list  which  has  to  be agreed  upon  locally.  In  order  to  guarantee  rapid dissemination of the warnings, the distribution list to be used shall, as for as possible, contain only one recipient for an interested group; this recipient will be responsible for the further dissemination of the warning within the group.

SIGMET  information  is  disseminated,  in  addition  to directed transmissions to aircraft general calls, as an aeronautical or radio broadcast;

a) by Ankara Area Control Centre for Ankara FIR and Istanbul  Area  Control  Centre  for  Istanbul  FIR  of responsibility.

b) By the ATS units for their own area of responsibilities.

The Information is broadcast from the MWO concerned and repeated every half and full hour during the period of validity of the SIGMET information
