#### 2.1.1. RVSM airspace

Ankara FIR  is RVSM transition airspace. The airspace within the Ankara FIR between FL290 and FL410 inclusive is EUR RVSM Transition Airspace. Within  this airspace, the vertical separation minimum shall be:

a) 1000 FT (300 M) between RVSM approved aircraft;

b) 2000 FT (600 M) between:

1. Non-RVSM approved State aircraft and any otheraircraft operating within the EUR-RVSM airspace;
2. Formation  flights  of  State  aircraft  and  any  otheraircraft operating within the EUR-RVSM airspace; and
3. An aircraft experiencing a communications failure inflight  and  any  other  aircraft,  when  both  aircraft  areoperating within the EUR-RVSM airspace.

Istanbul FIR is RVSM airspace. The airspace within the Istanbul FIR of theapplicable FIR between FL290 and FL410 inclusive is EUR RVSM Airspace. Within  this airspace, the vertical separation minimum shall be:

a) 1000 FT (300 M) between RVSM approved aircraft;

b) 2000 FT (600 M) between:

1. Non-RVSM approved State aircraft and any otheraircraft operating within the EUR-RVSM airspace;
2. Formation  flights  of  State  aircraft  and  any  otheraircraft operating within the EUR-RVSM airspace; and
3. An aircraft experiencing a communications failure inflight  and  any  other  aircraft,  when  both  aircraft  areoperating within the EUR-RVSM airspace.
