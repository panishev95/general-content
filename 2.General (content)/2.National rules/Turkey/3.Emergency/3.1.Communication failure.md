#### 3.1.1. Important information

- A controlled flight experiencing communication failure in VMC shall:

a) set transponder to Code 7600

b) continue to fly in VMC;

c) land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; and

d) report its arrival time by the most expeditious means to the appropriate ATS unit.

- A controlled IFR flight experiencing communication failure in IMC shall:

a) set transponder to Code 7600;

b) maintain for a period of 7 minutes the last assigned speed and level or the minimum flight altitude, if the minimum flight altitude is higher than the last assigned level. The period of 7 minutes commences:

1) if operating on a route without compulsory reporting points or if instructions have been received to omit position reports:

i) at the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached, or

ii) at the time the transponder is set to Code 7600

whichever is later; or

2)  If operating on a route with compulsory reporting points and no instruction to omit position reports has been received

i) at the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached, or

ii) at the previously reported pilot estimate for the compulsory reporting point, or

iii) at the time of a failed report of position over a compulsory reporting point,

whichever is later;

**NOTE:** The period of 7 minutes is to allow the necessary air traffic control and coordination measures.

c) thereafter, adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan;

d) If being radar vectored or proceeding offset according to RNAV  without a specified limit, proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin the current flight plan route no later than the next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude.

e)  proceed according to the current  flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid serving the destination aerodrome and hold over this aid until commencement of descent;

f) commence descent from the navigation aid at, or as close as possible to, the  expected approach time last received  and  acknowledged or, if no expected approach time  has been received and acknowledged, at, or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan;

g)  complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid; and

h) land, if possible, within thirty minutes after the estimated time of arrival or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later.
