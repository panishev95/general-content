### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure |      Altitude report      |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Below transition level    |      QNH, QFE      | Feet, meters (on request) |

#### 2.2.1. Important information

- In the airspace of Tukmenistan, the position of ACFT in vertical  plane when carrying out flight WI TMA below transition level during descending for landing  and during  climbing  after TKOF up to transition  ALT shall be assigned by ATC controller and reported by flight crews in ALT values in feet based upon QNH.

- On flight crew's REQ, during descending from transition level till landing and during climbing after TKOF up to transition HGT,  FLT can be  carried  out  with  reference  to QFE. In this case ATC controller providing FLT control shall assign HGT values in feet based upon QFE, or in metres on flight crew's REQ.

- If a flight is carried out in take-off and landing area at height below the transition level, the flight height is indicated relative to MSL.

- During  enroute flight below the lower  safe  flight level, QNH pressure shall be set by the flight crew on run-way before take-off.
