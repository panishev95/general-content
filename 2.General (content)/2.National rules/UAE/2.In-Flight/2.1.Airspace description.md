### 	2.1. Airspace description

| RVSM Airspace | Airspace classes |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| FL290 - FL410 |    A, C, D, G    |

#### 2.1.1. RVSM airspace

The RVSM vertical separation intervals are used in the airspace between FL290 and FL410. Acceptance of non - RVSM certified State aircraft for flight at RVSM levels is subject to prevailing traffic conditions. RVSM certified aircraft will be afforded priority in order to make maximum use of airspace capacity.

#### 2.1.2. CTA notes

- Abu Dhabi CTA Notes

  \* Lower limit 2,500 FT AMSL within the lateral limits of OMR 73

  Abu Dhabi Approach is responsible for provision of flight information and alerting service in class G airspace below the Abu Dhabi CTA.

  Military and Civilian VFR aircraft receiving a radar service operating within Abu Dhabi CTA and under ATC areas of responsibility; shall maintain VFR and remain in VMC at all times. ATC levels and headings are advisory only and VFR traffic in receipt of vector or level instructions is still responsible for maintaining VMC own terrain/obstacle clearance. Pilots must inform ATC as soon as practicable when unable to maintain VFR and request an alternative heading or altitude.

  Training Restrictions: Training not permitted except for operators based at OMAA/OMAL.

- Dubai CTA Notes

  1. VFR aircraft exempt from RNAV 1 requirements

  3. Maximum altitude in the DUBAI CTA for traffic from the Northern Emirates to OMAA/OMAD is 10,000 FT
  4. Requirement for rates of descent for aircraft operating in the DUBAI CTA. Crews commencing a descent in accordance with an ATC Instruction shall immediately advise ATC if their rate of descent during the level change will be less than 500 FT per minute.

#### 2.1.3. Table of cruising levels

Vertical separation shall be carried out according to the semicircular system.

When complying with the semi - circular system of cruising levels, an aircraft shall be flown at levels corresponding to the magnetic track shown in the table of cruising levels applicable in the Emirates FIR.
