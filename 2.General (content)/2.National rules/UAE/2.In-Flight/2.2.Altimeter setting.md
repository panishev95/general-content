### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

The altimeter setting procedures in use generally conform to those contained in ICAO Doc 8168 - OPS, Volume 1, Part III, Section 1, Chapter 4 and only differences are stated.

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    |        QNH         |       Feet        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)   | Flight Level (FL) |

#### 2.2.1. Important information

QNH reports are available from all Air Traffic Service units. QNH values are given in whole hectoPascal rounded down in accordance with the standards in ICAO Annex 3.

Transition altitude is fixed at 13,000 FT for the entire Emirates FIR.

Transition level is fixed at FL 150 for the entire Emirates UIR.

**2.2.2 Altimeter setting regions**

Due to the relatively small pressure differentials experienced across the Emirates FIR there are no altimeter setting regions specified. When required:

1. Aircraft in contact with Emirates ACC shall be issued with an area QNH.
2. Aircraft in contact with other ATS units shall normally be given the QNH applicable to the location of the ATS unit.
