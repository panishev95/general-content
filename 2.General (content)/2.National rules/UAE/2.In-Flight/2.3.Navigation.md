|      Coordinate system       | Minimum RNAV specifications | State minimums |
| :--------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :------------: |
| PZ-90, (identical to WGS-84) |        RNAV5, RNAV10        |       No       |

#### 2.3.1. Coordinate system

The national geodetic geocentric coordinate system “The Parameters of the Earth - 1990” PZ-90, (PZ-90.02), which is practically identical to WGS-84, is used in the Russian Federation. The geodetic system of 1942 (SK-42) shall be used temporarily at the aerodromes and on the airways where the accurate geodetic survey has not been carried out according to the coordinate system PZ-90.

#### 2.3.2. Vertical speed recommendations

In the process of climbing the flight crew maintains the recommended vertical speed restrictions of 7 m/s throughout the last 300 m to the assigned flight level (altitude) in order to prevent false alarm of an airborne collision avoidance system (or TCAS). 

#### 2.3.3. Lower flight level obstacle clearance

The lower (safe) flight level of a IFR flight is determined on the assumption that the absolute flight altitude of aircraft over the highest obstacle (obstacle clearance) within a 50 km width (25 km on both sides from the route centre line) route is not less than 600 m.

#### 2.3.4. RNAV

In the upper airspace, above the FL265, area navigation routes are established in the oceanic sectors of the Magadan and Murmansk FIR and their continuation over the continental territory, as well as routes along which the main air traffic flows from Europe to Southeast Asia, China, and Japan and back with the following navigation specifications:

- RNAV 5 - in the airspace over the territory of the Russian Federation;
- RNAV 10 - in the airspace outside the territory of the Russian Federation, where the responsibility for ATM is delegated to the Russian Federation and over the territory of the Russian Federation in the areas with a low level of development of the infrastructure of ground-based navigation aids.

#### 2.3.5. SLOP

SLOP are authorized within FIR Murmansk and FIR Magadan airspace only on the segments of ATS routes located within the Oceanic Sectors of the Arctic Ocean and over the Pacific Ocean high seas.

SLOP shall be carried out to the right from the centre line of the route relative to the flight direction with increase of 0.1 nm, maximum by 3.7 km (2 nm).
