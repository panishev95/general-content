ADS/CPDLC services within Ho Chi Minh FIR to all FANS-1/A equipped aircraft are available on a 24 hour basis.

ADS/CPDLC services are available in the 8 (eight) oceanic ATS routes including L625, L628, L642, M765, M768, M771, N500 and N892 within Ho Chi Minh FIR.

For aircraft having data link connection, CPDLC is utilized as the primary means of communications and VHF/HF voice will be used as secondary communication means. Depending on traffic loading, air traffic controllers may also use CPDLC within the range of VHF voice if the connection is still there.

All FANS-l/A equipped aircraft, which have CPDLC connection, shall be informed of frequency to be monitored while provided with data link services. ADS/CPDLC connection will be established either automatically or manually by ground system after logon procedure is completed.

ADS will be utilized as surveillance outside of radar coverage but ADS application shall not alter the current position report procedures (ADS-C separation is not to be used).

As Singapore ACC is already and currently providing data link services within the Singapore FIR, close coordination between Ho Chi Minh and Singapore ACCs for address forwarding function is necessary for a seamless ADS/CPDLC service within two FIRs.
