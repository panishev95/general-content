### INTERMEDIATE APPROACH SEGMENT

#### 1. General

This is the segment during which the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prepare the aircraft for final approach. For this reason, the descent gradient is kept as shallow as possible.

During the intermediate approach, the **obstacle clearance** requirement reduces from 300 m (984 ft) to 150 m (492 ft) in the primary area, reducing laterally to zero at the outer edge of the secondary area.

Where a final approach fix (FAF) is available, **the intermediate approach segment begins** when the aircraft is on the inbound track of the procedure turn, base turn or final inbound leg of the racetrack procedure. It ends at the FAF or final approach point (FAP), as applicable.

*Note.â€” Where no FAF is specified, the inbound track is the final approach segment.*
