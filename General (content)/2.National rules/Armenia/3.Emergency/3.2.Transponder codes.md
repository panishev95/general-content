### 3.2. **Emergency transponder codes**

|         Case          | SSR transponder code |
| :-------------------: | :------------------: |
|       Emergency       |    Mode A+C 7700     |
|     Radio failure     |    Mode A+C 7600     |
| Unlawful interference |     Mode A 7500      |

#### 3.2.1. Unlawful Interference

- Unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise, the pilot-in-command should attempt to continue flying on the assigned track and at the assigned cruising level at least until notification to an ATS unit is possible or the aircraft is within radar coverage.
- When an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference must depart from its assigned track or its assigned cruising level without being able to make radiotelephony contact with ATS, the pilot-in-command should, whenever possible:
  1. attempt to broadcast warnings on the VHF emergency frequency and other appropriate frequencies, unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise. Other equipment such as on-board transponders, data links, etc. should also be used when it is advantageous to do so and circumstances permit; and
  2. proceed in accordance with applicable special procedures for in-flight contingencies, where such procedures have been established and promulgated; or
  3. if no applicable regional procedures have been established, proceed at a level which differs from the cruising levels normally used for IFR flight in the area by 1 000 FT if above FL 410 or by 500 FT if below FL 410.
