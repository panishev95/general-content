#### 3.1.1. Important information

- The radar controller will establish whether the aircraft radio receiver is working by instructing the pilot to carry out a turn or turns, if the turns are observed the radar controller will continue to provide radar service to the aircraft.
- If the aircraftâ€™s radio is completely unserviceable, the pilot should carry out the procedures for radio failure in accordance with ICAO provisions. If radar identification has already been established, the radar controller will vector other identified aircraft clear of its track until such time as the aircraft leaves radar cover.
- In the event of an aircraft radio receiver failure, a pilot shall select mode A/3 code 76 (or 7600) and follow established procedures; subsequent control of the aircraft will be based on those procedures.
