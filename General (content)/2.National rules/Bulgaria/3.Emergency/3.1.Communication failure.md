### **3.1. Communication failure**

|            Case             | Emergency frequency |
| :-------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Radio communication failure |      121,5 MHz      |

#### 3.1.1. Important information

- Transponder-equipped  aircraft  experiencing communication  failure  will  operate  the  transponder  on Mode A, Code 7600;
- When it has been established by the controller, that the aircraftâ€™s radio receiver is functioning, continued service of transponder-equipped aircraft where SSR is available can be effected, using code changes or IDENT transmissions to obtain acknowledgement of clearances issued to the aircraft.
- As soon as it known that the  two-way communication has failed the pilot-in-command follow the procedures, given in items below.

#### 3.1.2. Actions in  the event of air-ground communication failure (VMC)

- As soon as it is known that two-way communication has failed, ATS units shall maintain separation between the aircraft having the communication failure and other aircraft based on the assumption that the aircraft will operate in accordance with the procedures in items below.
- Except  as provided for in item below, a controlled flight experiencing communication failure in VMC shall:
  1. set transponder to Code 7600;
  2. continue to fly in VMC;
  3. land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; and 
  4. report its arrival time by the most expeditious means to the appropriate ATS unit.

#### 3.1.3. Actions in  the event of air-ground communication failure (IMC)

A controlled IFR flight experiencing communication failure in IMC, where it does not appear feasible  to  continue in accordance with item above, shall:

- Set transponder to Code 7600;
- Maintain  for a period of 7 min the last as-signed speed and level or the minimum flight altitude, if the  minimum flight altitude is higher than the last as-signed level. The period of 7 min commences:

a) if  operating on a route without compulsory reporting points or if  instructions  have been received  to omit position reports:

- at the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached; or
- at the time the transponder is set  to Code7600, whichever is later; or

b) if operating on a  route  with compulsory reporting points and no instructions to omit position reports have been received:

- at the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached; or
- at  the previously reported pilot estimate for the compulsory reporting point; or
- at the time of a failed report of position over a compulsory reporting point, whichever is later

**Note:** The period of 7 min is to allow the necessary air traffic service and coordination measures

- Thereafter, adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan;
- If being radar vectored or operating on parallel tracks according to RNAV without restrictions proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin the current flight plan route no later than the next significant point, taking into consideration  the  applicable minimum flight altitude;
- Proceed according to the current flight  plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid serving the destination aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with item below, hold over this aid until commencement of descent;
- Commence descent from the  navigation aid specified in item above at, or as close as possible to,the    expected approach time last received and acknowledged or, if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, at, or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan;
- Complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid; and
- Land if possible, within 30 min after the estimated time of arrival specified in item above or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later.
