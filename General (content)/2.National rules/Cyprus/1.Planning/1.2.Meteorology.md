#### 1.2.1. Important information

Meteorological information which is supplied through VOLMET broadcast area:

- For Larnaka Airport: METAR, TREND, Aerodrome Warning and WS Warning;
- For Pafos Airport: METAR, Aerodrome Warning and WS Warning;
- For Nicosia FIR: SIGMET.

#### 1.2.2. Aerodrome Warnings

Aerodrome warnings are issued by Larnaka Meteorological Office, if one or several of the following phenomena are expected to occur at the airport: 

a.   Thunderstorm;

b.   Hail;

c.   Squall: sudden increase in wind speed over 22 KT by 16 KT, lasting over 1 MIN (in case of thunderstorms or active storms);

d.   Waterspouts;

e.   Tornadoes;

f.   Strong surface wind and gusts (mean speed 25 KT or more and/or gusts to 30 KT or more;also issued when runway crosswind is expected, with mean speed>20-25 KT);

g.   Gale (mean speed 34 KT or more and/or gusts to 43 KT or more);

h.   Fog: Fog or fog patches resulting in visibility ≤ 1000 M;

i.   Low cloud (Base: 1000 FT or less above aerodrome level and cloud amount ≥ SCT);

j.   Frost;

k.   Hoar frost or rime;

l.   Rising sand or dust;

m.  Low level vertical wind shear: if one of the following is/are satisfied:

1. Mean surface wind speed ≥ 25 KT;
2. Magnitude of vector between mean surface wind and the gradient (2000 FT) wind ≥ 40 KT;
3. Thunderstorms or heavy showers within 10 KM;
4. Significant wind shear (WS) has been reported by aircraft in the vicinity: Moderate WS 5-8 KT/30 M, strong WS 9-12 KT/30 M and severe WS >12 KT/30 M;

n.   Snow (including the expected or observed snow accumulation);

o.   Freezing precipitation;

p.   Sandstorm or dust storm;

q.   Volcanic ash;

r.   Tropical Cyclone (to be included if the 10-minute  mean surface wind speed at the aerodrome is expected to be 34 KT or more);

s.   Tsunami;

t.   Intense precipitation (either ≥ 45 mm/3 HR or ≥ 50 mm/6 HR or ≥ 55 mm/24 HR).
