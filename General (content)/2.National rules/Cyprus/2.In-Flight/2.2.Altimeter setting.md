### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure  |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    | QNH, QFE on request |       Feet        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)    | Flight Level (FL) |

#### 2.2.1. Important information

- Transition altitude is 9000ft and the transition level is fixed at FL110 (given on the instrument approach charts).
- QNH values and temperature information for use in determining adequate terrain clearance are provided in MET broadcasts and are available on request from the air traffic services units. QNH values are given in hectopascals.

- QNH altimeter setting is made available to aircraft in taxi clearance prior to take-off. A QFE altimeter setting, based on the relevant datum, is available on request only.
- Prior to take-off altimeter should be set to the latest QNH altimeter setting of the aerodrome.
- Transition altitudes are established at Larnaka and Pafos airports. The transition altitude for Larnaka and Pafos Airports is 9000 FT (2750 M) and the transition level is fixed to FL 110 irrespective of the QNH value.
- QNH altimeter setting is made available in approach clearance and in clearance to enter the traffic circuit. QFE altimeter setting is made available on request
