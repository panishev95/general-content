#### 2.4.1. Important Information

- An IFR flight operating outside controlled airspace and required by the competent authority to maintain an air-ground voice communication watch on the appropriate communication channel and establish two-way communication, as necessary, with the air traffic services unit providing flight information service, shall report position, as specified in SERA.8025 GEN-3.3 for controlled flights.

- Due to the closure of the direct communication line by TURKEY, direct communication and coordination between Ankara and Nicosia area control centres can not be effected, therefore:

  - Aircraft inbound to Nicosia FIR from Ankara FIR shall establish radio conduct with Nicosia ACC in order to pass essential flight details (CALLSIGN, FL, ETA at entry point) on frequency 125.5 MHz for TOMBI and 126.3 MHz for VESAR and DOREN, 10 minutes prior to entry;
  - Aircraft inbound to Ankara FIR from Nicosia FIR shall pass flight details to Ankara ACC before entering Ankara FIR.

  **NOTE:** Failure of any aircraft to establish contact with the accepting unit will result in the aircraft being treated as a radio failure and thus causing unnecessary complications in the application of RVSM. However in case at which aircraft fails to establish contact in due time according to para a) above, aircraft are requesting to call Nicosia ACC on the emergency frequency 121.5 MHz.
