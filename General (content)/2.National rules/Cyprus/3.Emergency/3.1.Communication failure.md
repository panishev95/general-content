| Radio communication failure |      121,5 MHz      |

#### 3.1.1. Important information

- Air traffic Control will maintain suitable separation between the  aircraft experiencing  the communications failure and other aircraft, based on the assumption that the aircraft which has experienced communications failure will:

- If in **Visual Meteorological Conditions** conditions shall:
  -    continue to fly in visual meteorological conditions;
  -    land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; and
  -    report its arrival by the most expeditious means to the appropriate air traffic control unit.

- If in **Instrument Meteorological Conditions**, a controlled IFR flight experiencing communication failure in IMC, or when the weather conditions are such that it does not appear feasible to complete the flight in accordance with the VMC conditions shall:

  a.   set transponder to code 7600;

  b.   unless otherwise prescribed on the basis of the regional agreement, maintain for a period of 7 minutes the last assigned, speed and level, or the minimum flight altitude, if the higher flight altitude is higher than the last higher assigned level. The period of 7 minutes commences:
- if operating on route without compulsory reporting points or if instructions have been received to omit position reports:
  - i.   at the time of the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached, or
  - ii.   at the time the transponder is set to Code 7600 which ever is later, or

- if operating on route with compulsory reporting points and no instruction to omit position reports has been received:

  - i.   at the time of the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached, or
  - ii.   at the previously reported pilot estimate for the compulsory reporting point, or 
  - iii.   at the time of a failed report of position over a compulsory reporting point, or
  - iv.   whichever is later;

  **NOTE:** The period of 7 minutes is to allow air traffic control to obtain the necessary coordination measures. 

  c.   Thereafter, adjust level and speed in accordance with the flight plan;

  **NOTE:** With regard to changes to levels and speed, the filed flight plan, which is the flight plan as filed with ATS unit by the pilot or a designated representative without any subsequent changes, will be used.

  d.   If being radar vectored or proceeding offset according to RNAV without a specified limit,proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin the current flight plan route no later than next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum altitude;

  e.   proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid serving the designation aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with f below, hold over this aid until commencement of descent;

  f.   commence decent from the navigation aid specified in **e** above at, or close as possible to, the  expected  approach  time last received and acknowledged or, if no expected approach time last reserved and acknowledged, or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan;

  g.   complete a normal instrument approach procedures as specified for the designated navigation aid; 

  h.   land, if possible, within thirty minutes after the estimate time of arrival specified in **e** or the last acknowledged expected approach time, which ever is later.

  **NOTE:** Pilots are reminded that the aircraft may not be in an area of Secondary Surveillance Radar coverage.
