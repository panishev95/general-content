|            Emergency            |    Mode A - 7700     |

#### 3.2.1. Unlawful interference

- An aircraft which is being subjected to unlawful interference shall endeavour to notify the appropriate ATS unit of this fact, any significant circumstances associated therewith and any deviation from the current flight plan necessitated by the circumstances, in order to enable the ATS unit to give priority to the aircraft and to minimize conflict with other aircraft.
- The following procedures are intended for use by aircraft when unlawful interference occurs and the aircraft is unable to notify an ATS unit of this fact.
- Unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise, the pilot-in-command should attempt to continue flying on the assigned track and the assigned cruising level at least until able to notify an ATS unit or within radar coverage.
- When an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference must depart from its assigned track or its assigned cruising level without being able to make radiotelephony contact with ATS, the pilot-in-command should, whenever possible:
  - Attempt to broadcast warnings on the VHF emergency frequency and other appropriate frequencies, unless considerations aboard the aircraft dictate otherwise. Other equipment such as on-board transponders, data links, etc. should also be used when it is advantageous to do so and circumstances permit; and
  - proceed in accordance with applicable special procedures for in-flight contingencies, where such procedures have been established and promulgated in the Regional Supplementary Procedures (Doc 7030); or
  - if no applicable regional procedures have been established, proceed at a level which differs from the cruising levels normally used for IFR flight in the area by:
    - 150 M (500 FT) in an area where a vertical separation minimum of 300 M (1000 FT) is applied;
    - Or 300 M (1000 FT) in area where a vertical separation minimum of 600 M (2000 FT) is applied.

**NOTE:** Action to be taken by an aircraft which is intercepted while being subject to an act of unlawful interference is prescribed in Annex 2 Chapter 3
