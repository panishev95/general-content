| Radio communication failure |      121,5 MHz      |

#### 3.1.1. Important information

In the event of complete communication failure the aircraft shall act in accordance with the communication failure procedures in the Rules of the Air and attempt to establish communication with the parent ATC unit or other ATS units as applicable.

1. If in instrument meteorological conditions or if the weather conditions the aircraft shall:

   a) set the transponder to code 7600; 

   b) maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 7 minutes. This time is counted from: 

   1) when the aircraft is on a route with no compulsory reporting points or it has been instructed to omit position reports, 

   i) the time when it reaches the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude; or 

   ii) the time when the transponder is set to code 7600, whichever is later; or 

   2) when the aircraft is on a route that contains compulsory reporting points and has not been instructed to omit position reports,

    i) the time when it reaches the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude; or 

   ii) the latest time over a compulsory reporting point as estimated by the pilot; or iii) the aircraftâ€™s failure to report its position over a compulsory re-porting point, whichever is later;

   c) thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan. 

   **Note:** The level and speed means the information given in the filed flight plan. 

   d) when being radar vectored or when the aircraft is proceeding offset using area navigation (RNAV) without a specified limit for rejoining the route specified in the current flight plan, rejoin the current flight plan route as soon as possible but no later than at the next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude. 

   **Note:** The flight route or the time when descent for the destination aerodrome is commenced means the information in accordance with the current flight plan. 

   e) proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid serving the destination aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with f) below, hold over this aid until commencement of descent; 

   f) commence descent from the navigation aid specified in e) at, or as close as possible to, the expected approach time last received and acknowledged; or, if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, at, or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan; 

   g) complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid; 

   h) land, if possible, within 30 minutes after the estimated time of arrival specified in f) or the last received and acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later. 

#### 3.1.2. CPDLC Failure

In case of a CPDLC failure, CPDLC clearances that have not yet been confirmed shall be repeated over voice communication and / or confirmed. If either the flight crew or ATC consider that CPDLC should not be used in the prevailing circumstances, CPDLC shall be suspended or terminated and the other party shall be informed by voice communication.
