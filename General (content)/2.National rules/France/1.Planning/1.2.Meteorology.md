  - on board radiation (RADIATION); and
  - satellite communications (SATCOM).

- Affected geographic areas are referenced by their latitudes and longitudes, and flight levels (ABV FL) for radiation. Abbreviations are also used:
  - High latitudes northern hemisphere (N9000 - N6000): HNH
  - Mid latitudes northern hemisphere (N6000 - N3000): MNH
  - Equatorial latitudes northern hemisphere (N3000 - N0000): EQN
  - Equatorial latitudes southern hemisphere (S0000 - S3000): EQS
