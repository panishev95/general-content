### 	2.1. Airspace description

| RVSM Airspace | Airspace classes |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| FL290 - FL410 |  A, C, D, E, G   |

#### 2.1.1. Important Information

- The regional control centres of PARIS, MARSEILLE, BORDEAUX, BREST and REIMS together provide coordination of controlled IFR movements. They also provide coordination with the centres responsible for control in airspaces located inside the following flight information regions:

  ALGIERS, BARCELONA BRUSSELS, FRANKFURT, GENEVA, LONDON, MADRID, MILAN, ROME, SHANWICK OCEANIC, ZURICH

- Unless the regional control centre indicates otherwise, every controlled IFR flight leaving from one of the flight information regions of PARIS, MARSEILLE, BORDEAUX, BREST or REIMS is implicitly authorized by the ACC following air traffic regulations from the first control clearance.

  - For its entire route if the aerodrome of destination is located inside one of the flight information regions specified above.
  - For the portion of its route performed in controlled airspaces located inside one of the flight information regions specified above, if the aerodrome of destination is located beyond that region.

#### 2.1.2. RVSM airspace

- The airspace UTA FRANCE between FL 290 and FL 410 inclusive is EUR RVSM airspace. Within this airspace, the vertical separation minimum shall be:

  - a) 300 metres (1000 feet) between RVSM approved aircraft

  - b) 600 metres (2000 feet) between :

    \- non-RVSM approved State aircraft and any other aircraft operating within the EUR RVSM airspace;

    \- formation flights of State aircraft and any other aircraft operating within the EUR RVSM airspace;

* Except for IFR flights in the upper control area (UTA) for which the table of cruising levels is modified, in order to accommodate predominant traffic directions, as follows:
  * «From 090 degrees to 269 degrees» instead of «From 000 degrees to 179 degrees» 
  * «From 270 degrees to 089 degrees» instead of «From 180 degrees to 359 degrees».

- The correlation of cruising levels to magnetic track prescribed above shall not apply whenever otherwise indicated:
  - for each ATS route segment or in RAD (Route Availability Document) for each direct (DCT) route segment; or
  - in air traffic control clearances.
