### 3.2. **Emergency transponder codes**

|            Case             | SSR transponder code |
| :-------------------------: | :------------------: |
|          Emergency          |    Mode A - 7700     |
| Radio communication failure |    Mode A - 7600     |
|    Unlawful interference    |    Mode A - 7500     |

- The pilot of an aircraft in emergency condition shall display code 7700, except if he was previously instructed by the air traffic control organism to display a specific code. In this case ; he shall continue to display this specific code, unless otherwise instructed by the air traffic control organism or if he thinks that displaying code 7700 is a better solution.
- If an aircraft in flight is subject to an illegal intervention, the pilot shall display code 7500 to report the situation, unless circumstances justify using code 7700.

#### 3.2.1.**Unlawful interference**

- If an aircraft in flight is the object of unlawful interference, the pilot in command shall try to set his transponder on Mode A code 7500 in order to signal the situation, unless the circumstances justify using Mode A code 7700.

  **Note** : An aircraft fitted with an SSR transponder is assumed to try and use group coded 7500 in mode A to indicate that it is the object of an unlawful interference. The aircraft can use the group coded 7700 in mode A to indicate that it is threatened by a serious and imminent danger and needs immediate assistance.
