### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure  |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    | QNH, QFE on request |       Feet        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)    | Flight Level (FL) |

#### 2.2.1. Important information

- There are three altimeter setting regions in Georgia:

  - Tbilisi TMA with transition altitude at 11000FT and fixed transition level at FL130;
  - Kutaisi TMA with transition altitude at 7000 FT and fixed transition level at FL90;
  - Batumi TMA with transition altitude at 7000 FT and fixed transition level at FL90.

- To determine terrain clearance the QNH values from the reporting station nearest to the position of the aircraft shall be used. For this purpose QNH values are available from all controlled aerodromes. 

  **Note.** Information mentioned above will not necessarily be available on a 24 hours basis. This depends on the hours of service for the unit providing such information.
