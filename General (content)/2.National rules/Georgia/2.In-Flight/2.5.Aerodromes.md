#### 2.5.1 Reporting of braking action

- The information on the braking action for each third of the runway starting with the runway threshold will be transmitted by SNOWTAMs. The information will be distributed in accordance with the following table:

| Code | Measured Friction Coefficient | Estimated Braking Action | Operational Meaning                                          |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5    | 0.40 and above                | Good                     | Pilots can expect to land without directional control problems |
| 4    | 0.39 – 0.36                   | Medium to Good           | Directional control might be impaired                        |
| 3    | 0.35 – 0.30                   | Medium                   | Directional control might be impaired                        |
| 2    | 0.29 – 0.26                   | Medium to Poor           | Directional control will be poor                             |
| 1    | 0.25 and below                | Poor                     | Directional control will be poor                             |
