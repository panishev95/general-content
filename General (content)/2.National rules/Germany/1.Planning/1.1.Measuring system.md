| For measurment of                                            | Units of measurement      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| In navigation:                                               | Nautical miles and tenths |
| Short distances, especially those relating to aerodromes:    | Metres                    |
| Altitudes, elevations and heights:                           | Feet                      |
| Horizontal speed including wind speed, airspeed, ground speed: | Knots                     |
| Vertical speed                                               | metres per second         |
| Vertical speed:                                              | Feet per minute           |
| Wind direction for landing and take-off:                     | Degrees magnetic          |
| Wind direction except for landing and take-off:              | Degrees true              |
| Visibility including runway visual range:                    | Kilometres or metres      |
| Altimeter setting:                                           | Hectopascal               |
| Atmospheric pressure:                                        | Hectopascal               |
| Temperature:                                                 | Degrees Celsius           |
| Mass:                                                        | Kilograms                 |

#### 1.1.1. Important information

- If requested by the pilot, the inch may also be used for altimeter setting.
- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is used in air traffic and communications services and in the documents published by the aeronautical information service (AIS), unless otherwise indicated.

- Times in brackets are the times during the summer period, e.g. 0900 – 1200 (0800 – 1100).

- The local time for Germany is the Central European Time: UTC+1 hour.

- The local time during the summer period is UTC+2 hours.

- The summer period starts on the last Sunday of March at 0100 and ends at 0100 on the last Sunday of October.
