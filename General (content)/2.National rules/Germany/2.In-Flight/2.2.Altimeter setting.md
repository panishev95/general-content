### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    |        QNH         |       Feet        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)   | Flight Level (FL) |

#### **2.2.1. Important information**

- For IFR flights the altitude at and below which the pilot shall set the altimeter to the QNH value transmitted by the competent ATC unit and above which he shall use the standard altimeter setting is established at 5000 ft MSL (transition altitude). For flights above the transition altitude, an altitude is established which, taking into account the valid QNH value, corresponds to the flight level for IFR, at least 1000 ft above the transition altitude (transition level).

- Prior to take-off for an IFR flight, the pilot shall set the altimeter to the QNH value transmitted by the competent ATC unit, and when passing the transition altitude, to the standard altimeter setting which is to be maintained enroute.

- On IFR approaches the pilot using the standard altimeter setting shall set the altimeter to the QNH value transmitted by the competent ATC unit when passing the transition level.
