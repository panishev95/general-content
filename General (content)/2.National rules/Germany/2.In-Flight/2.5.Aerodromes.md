#### 2.5.1. Low visibility operations definitions

**Low visibility operations (LVO)**

Arrival and take-off operations at a runway visual range (RVR) below 550 m and/or a decision height below 200 ft or taxi movements in RVRs below 550 m.

**Guided take-off**

A take-off in which the take-off run is not solely controlled with the aid of external visual references, but also with the aid of instrument references (e.g. ILS localiser).
**Note:** Guided take-offs are applied at RVRs 125 m but not less than 75 m.

**Low visibility take-off (LVTO)**

A take-off with a runway visual range (RVR) below 400 m.

**Low visibility procedures (LVP)**

Procedures applied at an aerodrome to ensure safe operations in low visibility conditions.
**Note:** To ensure stable operations in low visibility conditions at the above-mentioned airports, the low visibility procedures will be applied at an RVR of 600 m or less.

#### 2.5.2. Segregated parallel operations

Segregated parallel operations are conducted at Frankfurt/Main Airport at a distance of 1400 m between the runway centre lines of the parallel runways 25C and 25R.
