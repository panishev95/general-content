| Distance used in navigation, position reporting, etc. - generally in excess of 2 nautical miles | Nautical Miles and tenths                    |
| Relatively short distances such as those relating to aerodromes (e.g. runway lengths) | Metres                                       |
| Altitudes, elevations and heights                            | Feet                                         |
| Horizontal speed including wind speed                        | Knots                                        |
| Vertical speed                                               | Feet per minute                              |
| Wind direction for landing and taking off                    | Degrees Magnetic                             |
| Wind direction except for landing and taking off             | Degrees True                                 |
| Visibility including runway visual range                     | Kilometres or Metres                         |
