### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure  |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    | QNH, QFE on request |       Feet        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)    | Flight Level (FL) |

#### 2.2.1. Important information

- A transition altitude is specified for each aerodrome. No transition altitude is less than 3000 feet above an aerodrome.
- Transition altitudes are given on the instrument approach, STAR and SID charts. QNH reports and temperature information for use in determining adequate terrain clearance are provided in MET broadcasts and are available on request from the air traffic services units. QNH values are given in hectopascal.
- The reported QNH is valid within 25 NM.
- QFE altimeter settings are available on request.
- A QNH altimeter setting is made available in taxi clearance prior to take-off and in approach clearance and in clearance to enter the traffic circuit.
