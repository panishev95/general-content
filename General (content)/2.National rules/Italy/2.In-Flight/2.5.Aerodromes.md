#### 2.5.1. Runway condition

| Measured or calculated coefficient | Estimated braking action | Code |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---- |
| 0,40 and above                     | Good                     | 5    |
| from 0,39 to 0,36                  | Medium/Good              | 4    |
| from 0,35 to 0,30                  | Medium                   | 3    |
| from 0,29 to 0,2                   | Medium/Poor              | 2    |
| from 0,25 or below                 | Poor                     | 1    |

#### 2.5.2. Low visibility procedures

- Take off operations from a runway with RVR less than 400 m.
- In order to perform CAT II and CAT III operation sand take off with RVR less than 150 m (for categories A, B and C aircraft) or less than 200 m(for categories D and E aircraft), the operator must hold the relevant approval  issued  by the State to which it belongs.
- Low visibility take off from aerodromes not opened to CAT II and CAT III operations, is allowed only if special ow visibility aerodrome operation procedures have been implemented.
- For each flight in the Flight Plan, field 18, the applicable RVR minima for approach, landing and take  off  operations shall always be reported as in the following example. E.g.: RVR/150 RMK/LVTO RVR 125. All  declared values will be taken as reference in post-flight checks eventually carried out by ENAC.
