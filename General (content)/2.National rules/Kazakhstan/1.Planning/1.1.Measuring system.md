| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Distances used in navigation, position reporting, on charts, etc. | Nautical miles (NM), kilometres (km)                    |
| Short distances such as those relating to aerodromes (e.g. runway length) | Metres (m)                                              |
| Visibility including runway visual range                     | Metres or kilometres (m, km)                            |
| Altitudes, elevations and heights                            | Metres (m), feet (ft)                                   |
| Horizontal speed                                             | Kilometres per hour (km/h), knots (kt)                  |
| Wind speed                                                   | Metres per second (m/s)                                 |
| Vertical speed                                               | Feet per minute (ft/min)                                |
| Wind direction for landing and take-off                      | Degrees magnetic                                        |
| Wind direction except for landing and taking off             | Degrees true                                            |
| Altimeter setting                                            | Hectopascals (hPa), millimetres of mercury or millibars |
| Temperature                                                  | Degrees Celsius (Â°C)                                    |
| Weight                                                       | Metric tonnes or kilograms (t, kg)                      |
| Time                                                         | Hours, minutes and seconds (h,m,s)                      |
