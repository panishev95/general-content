#### 1.2.1. Important information

- The METAR and SPECI reports indicate visibility (for instrumental observations) depending on the length of the RWY:
  - at a RWY length of 1800 meters and less - the smaller of the two visibility values measured at both ends of the runway;
  - with a RWY length of more than 1800 meters - the smaller of the two values of visibility measured at the beginning and at the middle of the runway.
- The results of the RVR measurements are reported (in meters) during periods when the visibility or RVR is 2,000 meters or less.
- The height of a cloud base is indicated relative to the aerodrome elevation. Correction for height difference is entered in measured value of the cloud base height when the precision approach runway with a threshold exceeding by 10 meters (33 feet) or more from the elevation of the aerodrome is in use.

- The visibility included in TAF refers to the forecast minimal visibility specified in the report 
- Local regular reports, local special reports, METAR and SPECI reports indicate the type of current weather phenomena — ice crystals (very small) (IC), suspended ice crystals called diamond dust (reported with visibility of 5,000 meters or less associated with this phenomenon)

- Aerodrome warnings are issued due to the occurrence or expected occurrence of one or more of the following weather phenomena and conditions:
  - thunderstorms;
  - hail;
  - heavy snow and / or snow showers;
  - freezing precipitation (ice);
  - freezing mist;
  - frost or frost-mist;
  - squall, tornado;
  - sand or dust storm;
  - rising sand and dust;
  - winds with a speed of 15 m / s or more (including gusts), regardless of the direction;
  - volcanic ash or volcanic ash deposits;
  - toxic chemicals emissions;
  - lowering of air temperature to minus 30 °С and lower, or its raising to plus 35 °С and higher;
  - other phenomena consistent at the local level.
