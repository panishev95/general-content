- HF radio communication stations, operating on different frequencies in day-time and night-time, are marked with index “HJ” (day) and “HN” (night). The absence of these marks indicates that stations operate continuously during working hours.

- In the case of interference at assigned frequencies, a reserve (alternative) frequency of 129.0 MHz is applied.
- In the case of interference on the primary LOM and LMM channels, ATS may coordinate the change of frequency to one of the following:
  - LOM - 725 KHz / LMM - 355 KHz or
  - LOM - 355 KHz / LMM - 725 KHz.
- Transfer to reserve frequencies is performed when directed by ATS.
