|  CATII, CATIII, Take-off  |             Nil              |

#### 2.5.1. Low visibility procedures

- Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) are effected when RVR is less than 550 m. Low Visibility Procedures are cancelled when RVR is greater than 550 m.

- The operation of LVP shall be reported by Tower ATC phrase: “LOW VISIBILITY PROCEDURES IN OPERATION”.

- Low visibility procedures are described at the AD section.


#### 2.5.2. Measurement of Braking Action

| **Measured coefficient, µ**        | 0.1  | 0.15 | 0.2  | 0.25 | 0.3  | 0.35 | 0.4  | 0.45 | 0,5  | 0,55 | 0,6  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Normative friction coefficient** | 0.26 | 0.29 | 0.32 | 0.34 | 0.37 | 0.39 | 0.42 | 0.45 | 0,49 | 0,54 | 0,57 |

**Note:** The value of the normative friction coefficient of 0.3 corresponds to the value of the measured friction coefficient of 0.17

- At the aerodromes of Almaty, Aktobe, Aktau, Atyrau, Karaganda, Kostanay, Kyzylorda, Nur-Sultan, Pavlodar, Taraz, Turkistan, Uralsk, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Shymkent and Zhezkazgan the information on the runway pavement condition is transmitted by ATIS as follows:

  - in English in the form of the estimated braking action, determined from the value of the measured coefficient "μ";
  - in Russian in the form of numerical values of the normative friction coefficient.

  At all other aerodromes, the information on the runway pavement condition is transmitted as numerical values of the normative friction coefficient in English and Russian.

- The relation between the values of code numbers, the values  of  measured  friction  coefficients,  the  values  of  the normative friction coefficients, the estimated surface friction and the operational values are given in the following table:
