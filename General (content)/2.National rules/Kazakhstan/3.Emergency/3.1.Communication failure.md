#### 3.1.1. Important information

- After communication failure in the Kazakhstan airspace, the pilot-in-command shall continue its flight in accordance with the flight plan, taking at the same time all measures to re-establish radio communication. For this purpose, he uses the channels of ACC, APP, supplementary radio stations and on-board radio stations of other aircraft.
- If two-way communication was not re-established and the aircraft radio receivers are working fine, the aircraft crew shall nevertheless obtain the necessary flight information and the ATC instructions. For this purpose, he shall continuously monitor the radio communication channels of ground radio stations of the ACC and APP controllers, as well as the frequency of non-directional radio beacon and the VOR (DVOR) omnidirectional radio beacon of landing aerodrome or the nearest aerodrome along the route located in the ATS area.
- Crossing the state border without radio communication is prohibited, except for cases when radio communication failure occurred in flight under the direct control of ATC unit of the Republic of Kazakhstan or after obtaining its clearance to cross the state border.
- In the case of radio communication failure at a descending, the pilot-in-command reaches flight level (height) assigned earlier by the ATC unit and the aircraft is flying to the landing aerodrome at this level (height) with further approach to it by the established scheme.
- In the case of radio communication failure after take-off, the pilot-in-command shall perform the flight by the established scheme and land at the departure aerodrome. In this case, the aircraft crew is allowed to land in meteorological conditions below the operating aerodrome minimum.
- If a landing to an arriving aerodrome is impossible after balked landing or missed approach, the pilot-in-command should proceed to the alternate aerodrome according to the SID schemes climbing to the lowest safe flight level. Alternatively he should follow to the alternate aerodrome to backward direction of flight path on the nearest opposite lower FL stated in the flight plan or to the alternate aerodrome in the direction of flight path on the FL stated in the flight plan.
- An aircraft returns to the departure aerodrome or diverts to an alternate aerodrome located to backward direction of flight path on the nearest opposite lower FL stated in the flight plan and not lower than the lowest safe flight level.
- In the case of radio communication failure while IFR flight performing and transition from IFR to VFR is not possible, the aircraft:
  - in airspace where procedural separation is being applied, maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 20 minutes following the aircraft’s failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan;
  - in airspace where an ATS surveillance system is used in the provision of air traffic control, maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 7 minutes following:
    - the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached, or
    - the time the transponder is set to Code 7600, or
    - the aircraft’s failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point, whichever is later and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan.
  - when being radar vectored or having been directed by ATC to proceed offset using area navigation (RNAV) without a specified limit rejoin the current flight plan route no later than the next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude;
  - proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid or fix serving the destination aerodrome. Then it shall hold over this aid or fix until commencement of descent taking into account the provisions of below sub-item (e) if necessary;
  - commence descent from the navigation aid or fix at, or as close as possible to, the expected approach time last received and acknowledged; or, if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, at, or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan;
  - complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid or fix;
  - lands, if possible, within 30 (thirty) minutes after the estimated time of arrival or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later.

- In the case of communication failure with the TOWER controller while executing a missed approach, the crew shall switch to other frequency with the RADAR or APPROACH controller and follow his instructions.
- If the aircraft has not appeared and has not landed within 30 min for landing, all limitations for other aircraft at the aerodrome are removed.
