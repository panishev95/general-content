#### 3.1.1. Important information

- In case of a failure of radio communication with ATC unit the flight crew shall take measures to restore this communication using all other available facilities and, in case of being in CTA or CTR of the controlled aerodrome, shall watch the signals, which can be transmitted from the ground.
- In case of radio communication failure under **VMC** the aircraft shall:

1. continue a flight under VMC, carry out landing at the nearest suitable aerodrome and report its arrival to ATC unit using the aids of the most fast transmission of information;
2. terminate the flight under IFR as in accordance with the requirements of the present rules if it deemed expedient.

- In case of radio communication failure under **IMC** and making a decision to terminate the flight, the aircraft shall:
  - a.	unless otherwise stipulated by the regional air navigation agreement, in the airspace, where ATC is carried out without using the radar, maintain the last assigned speed and flight level or the minimum safe flight altitude/height for 20 minutes after the flight crew could not report its position at the compulsory reporting point, and after that the aircraft shall adjust the flight level and speed as in accordance with the submitted flight plan;
  - b.	in the airspace, where the radar is used for ATC, maintain the last assigned speed and flight level or the minimum safe flight altitude/height for 7 minutes after:

1. the time of reaching the last assigned flight level or the minimum safe flight altitude/height; or

2. the time of setting the transponder to code 7600; or

3. the flight crew has failed to report its position at the compulsory reporting point;

   whichever is later and after that the aircraft shall adjust the flight level and speed as in accordance with the submitted flight plan;

   - under radar vectoring or after obtaining the ATC instruction to carry out a lateral offset using RNAV without specified limit, the aircraft shall join the route indicated in the current flight plan not later than at the next significant point taking into account the applied minimum safe flight altitude/height;
   - continue a flight along the route according to the current flight plan to the appropriate navigation facility or to the point, when it is required to observe the provisions of sub-item (e) of the present paragraph, shall carry out a flight in the holding area over this facility or the point before commencing to descend;
   - commence to descend from the navigation facility or the point exactly at the expected approach time, obtained and confirmed during the last radio contact, or as close to it as possible, or, if the estimated approach time has not been obtained and confirmed, the aircraft shall commence to descend at the estimated arrival time or as close to this time, indicated in the current flight plan, as possible;
   - complete the normal instrument approach under IFR as in accordance with the procedure established for the given navigation facility or the point; and
   - carry out landing, as far as possible, within 30 minutes after the estimated arrival time or the last confirmed estimated approach time, whichever is later.
