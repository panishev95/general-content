### 	2.4. Communication

| Radiotelephony language |   CPDLC   |
| :---------------------: | :-------: |
|         English         | Available |

#### 2.4.1. Radiotelephony language

English is used in radio communication between aircraft and ATC units.

#### 2.4.2. The use of CPDLC

CPDLC is available for all properly equipped flights operating as general air traffic in accordance with the instrument flight rules within the controlled airspace above FL 285.

The following CPDLC services are provided in this airspace:

1. DLIC (data link initiation capability)
2. ACL (ATC clearances and instructions)
3. ACM (ATC communications management)
4. AMC (ATC microphone check)

The use of CPDLC is not mandatory in the RIGA FIR. CPDLC is conducted at the discretion of ATC and by the initiative of the pilot concerned.
Initial contact with ATS unit is provided by voice communication.
Voice shall remain as the primary mean of communication in time-critical situations.

***Flight Plan***

Pilot intending to conduct CPDLC communications within the RIGA FIR shall file the flight plan as follows:

- in Item 10a - J1 for CPDLC ATN VDL Mode 2 capable aircraft;
- in Item 18 - the indicator CODE/ followed by the aircraft 24-bit address expressed in an alphanumerical code of six hexadecimal characters.

***CPDLC Use***

Within the RIGA FIR CPDLC exchanges may only be conducted when the aircraft is under control of RIGA ACC. In the area of responsibility of RIGA ACC, voice communication and radiotelephony instructions have priority over CPDLC instructions at all times.CPDLC clearance shall not be executed by the crew until the pilot has sent a WILCO message in response to the CPDLC clearance or instruction received.Voice read back is not required for any CPDLC instruction.

In case of any uncertainty about a data link message, voice communication shall always be used. If the pilot or ATC is in the opinion that CPDLC should no longer be used in the given circumstances, CPDLC shall be discontinued or terminated and the other party shall be informed about this by voice communication.

***Data Link Communications Initiation Capability (DLIC) – Log-on***

The data link address for RIGA ACC is EVRR.
Normally log-on should be initiated 10 to 15 minutes prior to entering the RIGA FIR. Log-on shall be initiated by the pilot. The pilot shall log-on using ICAO callsign as filed in the flight plan.Irrespective of the number of RIGA ACC sectors which are entered during the flight, only one log-on per flight is required.

***ATC Clearances and Information service (ACL)***

The pilot may request changes to flight levels (climb or descent) or clearance direct to a point on the route via the data link. The pilot can send emergency messages via the data link as well.

***ATC Communications Management service (ACM)***

The pilot response to an ATC instruction to change frequency shall be WILCO. If the crew is unable to comply with this data link instruction, the pilot shall revert to voice communication to inform the ATC. When an aircraft is transferred to an adjacent sector / ATS unit by data link, the pilot shall acknowledge the instruction by WILCO, and then shall contact the next sector / ATS unit by voice communication on the assigned frequency.

***ATC Microphone Check service (AMC)***

A "Check Stuck Microphone" instruction may be sent by an ATC in case the aircraft is inadvertently blocking a radio frequency. If the "Check Stuck Microphone" instruction relates to the radio telephony frequency currently being used, the pilot shall check that the aircraft radio equipment is not causing the blockage. If the "Check Stuck Microphone" instruction does not relate to the radio telephony frequency being used, no further actions by the pilot are required.

***Construction of CPDLC Messages***

The text of messages shall be composed in standard predefined message format (e.g. CPDLC message set). Normally the use of free text messages should be avoided. Long messages or messages with multiple requests elements (multi-element messages) must not be used. 

A list of the standard CPDLC messages available for the exchanges in the RIGA FIR, along with appropriate responses are presented below.

***Responding to CPDLC Messages***

When a controller or pilot communicates via CPDLC, the response should be via CPDLC. When a controller or pilot communicates via voice, the response should be via voice.

***Reverting from CPDLC to Voice***

When an immediate response and / or action are required the air-ground communications shall revert to voice.When it is required to clarify the meaning or the intent of any unexpected, inappropriate or ambiguous CPDLC message, the air-ground communications shall revert to voice.When it is necessary to ensure the timely execution of an instruction issued by CPDLC, the air-ground communications shall revert to voice.When a system generates a time-out or an error for a CPDLC message the air-ground communications shall revert to voice.When corrective actions are required with respect to the unintended messages that have been sent using CPDLC, the air-ground communications shall revert to voice conforming to communication procedures as set out in PANS-ATM.

***Message Restrictions and Error Management***

If a message received is not supported by a ground system or constitutes an error to the technical rules for CPDLC communication, flight crew will receive an automatic reply indicating the nature of the error and, if applicable, required actions.

***CPDLC Failure***

In case of CPDLC failure, an ATC will instruct all data link equipped aircraft to revert to voice communications.In case of on-board CPDLC failure, the pilot shall revert to voice communications and inform appropriate ATC unit.

***Discontinuation of the Use of CPDLC Pilot Requests***

In order to manage the sector workload, a controller may require all stations or a specific flight to avoid sending CPDLC requests for a limited period of time.

***Log-off***

Log-off is conducted automatically on leaving the RIGA FIR. No pilot action is required.
