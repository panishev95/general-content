### 	2.1. Airspace description

| RVSM Airspace | Airspace classes |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| FL290 - FL410 |     C, D, G      |

#### 2.1.1. RVSM airspace

The airspace within the Vilnius FIR/UIR between FL 290 and FL 410 inclusive is EURRVSM airspace. Within this airspace, the vertical separation minimum shall be:

- 1 000 FT (300 M) between RVSM approved aircraft;
- 2 000 FT (600 M) between:

1. non-RVSM approved State aircraft and any other aircraft operating within the EUR RVSM airspace;
2. formation flights of State aircraft and any other aircraft operating within the EUR RVSM airspace;
3. an aircraft experiencing a communications failure in flight and any other aircraft, when both aircraft are operating within the EUR RVSM airspace.

#### 2.1.2. Free Route Airspace

- The Lithuanian Free Route Airspace (EYSFRA) is available for aircraft operators (AOs) H24/7. The AOR of Vilnius ACC represents the airspace encompassed by the lateral limits of Vilnius FIR/UIR. The vertical extension of EYSFRA is from FL 095 to FL 660.

- Within EYSFRA, there will be no limitations on the length/number of DCT.

- The ATS route network still available above FL 095.

- Eligible flights are those operating within VILINUS FIR/UIR whose planned trajectory a partially or entirely above FL 095.

- Entry and exit from the EYSFRA shall be planned using the published FRA horizontal entry and FRA horizontal exit points only.

- EYSFRA airspace users will be able to cross VILNIUS FIR/UIR boundary on DCT routing on pre-coordinated by the air traffic service provider route.

- The planning of DCT segments closer than 5 NM to the EYSFRA border is not allowed.

- The direction of cruising levels (EVEN or ODD) must be chosen depending on the direction of flight level required over the FRA horizontal entry and FRA horizontal exit points as described in the following table:

  | FLs over EYSFRA entry point | FLs over EYSFRA exit point |                      FLs inside EYSFRA                      |
  | :-------------------------: | :------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
  |            EVEN             |            EVEN            |                EVEN FLs for all DCT segments                |
  |             ODD             |            ODD             |                ODD FLs for all DCT segments                 |
  |            EVEN             |            ODD             | A change from EVEN to ODD FLs must be planned inside EYSFRA |
  |             ODD             |            EVEN            | A change from ODD to EVEN FLs must be planned inside EYSFRA |
