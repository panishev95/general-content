### 	2.5. Aerodromes

| Low visibility procedures | Braking action restrictions |
| :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: |
|           CATII           |            0.30             |

#### 2.5.1. Low Visibility procedures

- ILS Category II is established at Kaunas for RWY 26 and Vilnius for RWY 01 aerodromes

#### 2.5.2. Friction coefficient

- In international airports of Vilnius, Kaunas, Palanga and the military aerodrome of Šiauliai, operated for civil flights, the following RWY friction coefficients are established: 

| New RWY surface friction coefficient | RWY surface friction coefficient when surface is in need of repair | Minimum Friction Coefficient of RWY surface |
| :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
|                 0.70                 |                             0.52                             |                    0.42                     |

- If it is foreseen that RWY friction coefficient characteristics will degrade and become lower than the minimal friction coefficient value, a runway shall be notified by NOTAM as “wet and slippery”.
- When RWY is notified as “wet and slippery” a pilot-in-command may ask an airport operator for some additional information. However, the pilot-in-command is given responsibility for any calculations or specifications made by him after reception of additional information. 
- If a runway coefficient of friction in winter is lower than 0.30 appropriate measures shall be taken to improve it.
- Information on braking action will be given in terms of friction numbers (friction coefficients indicated with two digits after comma) when based on measurements. In addition the kind of measuring device used will be reported. When braking action is estimated the plain language will be used.

| **Measured friction coefficient** | **Estimated braking action** | **Code** |

| 0.40 and above                    | good                         | 5        |

| 0.29-0.26                         | medium to poor               | 2        |
| 0.25 or below                     | poor                         | 1        |
