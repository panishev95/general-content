### 3.3. **Interception rules**

- An aircraft which is intercepted by another aircraft shall immediately:
  - follow the visual signals given by the intercepting aircraft,
  - notify, if possible, the appropriate air traffic services unit,
  - attempt to establish radio communication with the intercepting aircraft or with the appropriate intercept control unit, by making a general call on the emergency frequency 121.5 MHz, giving the identity of the intercepted  aircraft and the nature of the flight; and if no contact has been  established and if practicable, repeating this call on the emergency  frequency 243 MHz,
  - follow instructions received by radio from the intercepting aircraft,
  - if equipped with SSR transponder, select Mode A, Code 7700, unless  otherwise instructed by the appropriate air traffic services unit.
- If any instructions received by radio from any sources conflict with those given by the intercepting aircraft by visual signals, the intercepted  aircraft shall request immediate clarification while continuing to  comply with the visual instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.
- If any instructions received by radio from any sources conflict with those given by the intercepting aircraft by radio, the intercepted aircraft  shall request immediate clarification while continuing to comply with  the radio instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.
- If radio contact is established during interception but communication in a common language is not possible, the following procedures apply:
  - the intercepting aircraft will attempt to convey instructions to the  intercepted aircraft and collect and pass essential information by using the phrases in Table 1 below, and
  - the intercepted aircraft shall attempt to acknowledge instructions and pass essential information by using the phrases in Table 2 below.
