| Radio communication failure |      121,5 MHz      |

#### 3.1.1. Important information

- As soon as it is known that two-way communication has failed, action shall be taken to ascertain whether the aircraft is able to receive transmissions from the air traffic control unit by requesting it to execute a specified manoeuvre which can be observed by radar or ADS-B or to transmit, if possible, a specified signal in order to indicate acknowledgement.

- If the aircraft fails to indicate that it is able to receive and acknowledge transmissions, separation shall be maintained between the aircraft having the communication failure and other aircraft, based on the assumption that the aircraft will:

  a) if in **visual meteorological** conditions:

     1) set the transponder to Code 7600;

     2) continue to fly in visual meteorological conditions;

     3) land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; and

     4) report its arrival by the most expeditious means to the appropriate air traffic control unit; or

  b) if in **instrument meteorological** conditions or when conditions are such that it does not appear likely that the pilot will complete the flight in accordance with a):

     1) set the transponder to Code 7600;

     2) unless otherwise prescribed on the basis of a regional air navigation agreement, in airspace where procedural separation is being applied, maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 20 minutes following the aircraft’s failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan; or

     3) in airspace where an ATS surveillance system is used in the provision of air traffic control, maintain       the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 7 minutes following:

  ​    i) the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached; or

     ii) the time the transponder is set to Code 7600 or the ADS-B transmitter is set to indicate the loss of air-ground communications; or

     iii) the aircraft’s failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point;

  whichever is later and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan;

     4) when being vectored or having been directed by ATC to proceed offset using RNAV without a specified limit, proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin the current flight plan route no later than over the next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude;

     5) proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid or fix serving the destination aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with 6), hold over this aid or fix until commencement of descent;

     6) commence descent from the navigation aid or fix specified in 5) at, or as close as possible to, the expected approach time last received and acknowledged; or, if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, at, or as close as possible to the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan;

     7) complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid or fix; and

     8) land, if possible, within 30 minutes after the estimated time of arrival specified in 6) or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later.
