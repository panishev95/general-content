### 3.3. **Interception rules**

- A civil aircraft which does not follow the instructions given by the air traffic services unit and there is justified suspicion that it may endanger interests of the State or public security, may be intercepted by authorized military aircraft.

  - b. notify, if possible, appropriate air traffic services unit;
  - c. attempt to establish radiocommunication with the intercepting aircraft or with the appropriate intercept control unit, by making a general call on the emergency frequency 121.500 MHz, giving its identity and the nature of flight; if no contact has been established and if practicable, repeat this call on the emergency frequency 243 MHz;
  - d. if equipped with SSR transponder, select Mode A code 7700, unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate air traffic services unit.

- If any instructions received by radio from any source conflict with those given by the intercepting aircraft by visual signals, the intercepted aircraft shall request immediate clarification while continuing to comply with the visual instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.
- If any instructions received by radio from any sources conflict with those given by the intercepting aircraft by radio, the intercepted aircraft shall request immediate clarification while continuing to comply with the radio instructions given by the intercepting aircraft.

- If radio contact is established during interception but communication in a common language is not possible, attempts shall be made to convey instructions, acknowledgement of instructions and essential information by using the phrases and pronunciations in the following table, transmitting each phrase twice:
