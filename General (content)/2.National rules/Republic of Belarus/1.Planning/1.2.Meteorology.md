#### 1.2.1. Important information

- Wind shear values at the aerodromes should be measured when special equipment is available, as well as by reports of crews of aircraft landing at or take-off from the aerodrome.

- Atmospheric pressure shall be measured and QNH and QFE values to be reported shall be calculated to the tenths of a hectopascal (hPa) or millimetres of mercury column (mm Hg) and rounded down to the nearest hectopascal (mm Hg).

- On the routes flight crews are provided with information on volcanic ash clouds through the issuance of NOTAM.

- Aircraft observations are carried out during a flight within Minsk FIR as well as during take-off or approach of aircraft at the aerodrome regarding to weather phenomena, which in the opinion of the pilot-in-command may affect safety and efficiency of other aircraft operations or were not accurately forecasted.

- Pilot-in-command shall always report about icing (irrespective of intensity), moderate or severe turbulence, thunderstorm, hail, volcanic ash cloud and encountered low-altitude wind shear, even if previously reported to aircraft. Reports on meteorological observation should be promptly provided to the appropriate ATS unit.

- The aerodrome warnings are issued due to actual or expected occurrence of one or more phenomena and conditions as follows:

  - thunderstorm;
  - hail;
  - severe snow (longer than 2 hours);
  - freezing precipitation;
  - rime;
  - duststorm or sandstorm (visibility is 1000 m or less);
  - wind speed of 15 m/s and more (taking into consideration gusts) irrespective of its direction;
  - squall;
  - transition of temperature through 0° C to negative values;
  - decrease in a temperature to minus 25°C or below, or temperature increase to 25°C or above. 

  *Note: Any differences from these criteria should be locally coordinated.*
