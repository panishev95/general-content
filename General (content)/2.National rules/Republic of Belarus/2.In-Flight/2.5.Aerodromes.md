### 	2.5. Aerodromes

| Low visibility procedures | Breaking action restrictions |
| :-----------------------: | :--------------------------: |
|       CATII, CATIII       |             0.17             |

#### 2.5.1. Low visibility procedures

- The announcement of suitability of airfield for flights on the categories II/III means that it is properly equipped and that the procedures corresponding for such flights are established and are applied in the corresponding conditions.
- Low visibility procedures at the aerodrome are entered by the ATS unit when visibility is less than 800 m (visibility on the runway is less than 550 m).

#### 2.5.2. Breaking action

- Information on braking conditions for each third of the runway is transferred to SNOWTAM. A ratio between values of the measured FCT, efficiency of braking and operational values are provided in the following table:

| **Code** | **Measurement FCT by ATT-2 (SFT)** | **Estimated BA** |                   **Operational meaning**                    |
| :------: | :--------------------------------: | :--------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    5     |           0.40 and above           |       good       | ACFT can be expected to land without undue directional control problems |
|    4     |             0.39-0.36              |  medium to good  |                                                              |
|    3     |             0.35-0.30              |      medium      |       Deterioration of directional control is possible       |
|    2     |             0.29-0.26              |  medium to poor  |                                                              |
|    1     |           0.25 and below           |       poor       |               Directional control will be poor               |

***Note:** The metal ruler is applied to measurement of thickness of a layer of rainfall.

- RWY is considered technically unusable and is subject to closing for cleaning when braking coefficient is less than 0.17 (for ACFT with turbine engine) and also in the presence of the following precipitation layer on RWY:

1. slush and sleet – more than 12 mm;
2. dry snow – more than 50 mm;
3. water – more than 10 mm.
