### **3.1. Communication failure**

|            Case             | Emergency frequency |

| Radio communication failure |      121,5 MHz      |

#### 3.1.1. Important information

- Radio communication is considered to be lost if using the available radio communication channels the crew does not answer repeated calls within 5 minutes.
- In case of radio communication failure the ATS unit shall determine the nature of radio communication failure by sending commands to the crew to set transponder to “IDENT” mode or to perform a turn or turns. If the actions mentioned above have failed, they shall be repeated on other frequencies that the crew can listen to, including the frequencies of voice communication, radio navigation aids and approach aids.
- If the aircraft radio is completely unserviceable, the pilot should carry out the procedures for radio failure in accordance with ICAO Regional Supplementary Procedures Doc 7030. If radar identification has already been established, the radar controller will vector other identified aircraft clear of its track until such time as the aircraft leaves radar cover.
