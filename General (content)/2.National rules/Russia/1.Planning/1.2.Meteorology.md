#### 1.2.1. Important information

- In local routine and special reports the wind direction is reported from magnetic meridian when the magnetic variation value is 5 degrees or more. 
- In local routine and special reports the runway visual range is reported when visibility is 2000 m or less according to the data of instrumental measurements or visual observations.
- SPECI are issued if runway visual range is improving and changes to or passes through one or several of the following values or runway visual range is deteriorating and reaches less than one or several of the following meanings: 150, 350, 600 or 800 m. 
- The height of cloud base is always reported relative to runway threshold. In case the difference between the elevation of runway threshold and the elevation of the site of the measuring instrument installation is more than 10 m a correction is introduced into the value of cloud base height. The values of cloud base height divisible by 10 m are indicated in local routine and special reports.
- The state of the runway is reported by eight-digit group before TREND landing forecast and also by eight-digit group or in unencoded form in RMK group.
