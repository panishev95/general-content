### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure |  Altitude report  |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
|    Below transition level    |      QNH, QFE      |   Feet, Meters    |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)   | Flight Level (FL) |

#### 2.2.1. Important information

- Flights at transition level or above shall be operated according to the indications of the altimeter which is set to QNE, during this phase of flight the aircraft position in the vertical plane is expressed in terms of flight levels (FL).
- During the flight within the controlled aerodrome area at the transition height/altitude or below (from take-off until reaching the transition height/altitude and from the transition level till landing) the aircraft position in the vertical plane shall be assigned by the controller and reported by the pilot in height values in metres based under QFE or in feet based upon QNH depending on its publication applied to a specific aerodrome diagram.
- During the flight outside the aerodrome area below the transition level of the area, where the air traffic control service in FIR is provided, the aircraft position in the vertical plane shall be assigned by the controller and reported by the pilots in altitude values in feet or in metres based upon the area QNH.
