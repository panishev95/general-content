| Distance used in navigation position reporting               | Nautical Miles and tenths*                   |
| Relatively short distances such as those relating to aerodromes (e.g. runway lengths) | Metres                                       |
| Altitudes, elevations and heights                            | Metres, Feet*                                |
| Horizontal speed including wind speed                        | Knots*                                       |
| Vertical speed                                               | Feet per minute*                             |
| Wind direction for landing and take-off                      | Degrees magnetic                             |
| Wind direction except for landing and taking off             | Degrees true                                 |
| Visibility, including RVR                                    | Kilometres or metres                         |
| Altimeter setting                                            | Hectopascal                                  |
| Temperature                                                  | Degrees Celsius                              |
