### 	2.1. Airspace description

| RVSM Airspace | Airspace classes |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| FL290 - FL410 |    C, D, E, G    |

#### 2.1.1. RVSM airspace

The airspace within the Beograd UIR between FL 290 and FL 410 both inclusive is EUR RVSM airspace. Within this airspace, the vertical separation minimum shall be:

- 1000 FT (300 M) between RVSM approved aircraft;
- 2000 FT(600 M) between:
  - non-RVSM approved State aircraft and any other aircraft operating within the EUR RVSM airspace;
  - formation flights of State aircraft and any other aircraft operating within the EUR RVSM airspace; and
  - an aircraft experiencing a communications failure in flight and any other aircraft, when both aircraft are operating within the EUR RVSM airspace

#### 2.1.2. Airspace classes

**Serbia:**

- ICAO class C: in controlled airspace (TMAs, CTA, UTA) except in control zones (CTR) and aerodrome traffic zones (ATZ) when active;
- ICAO class D: in all CTRs within working hours of an air traffic control unit responsible for the provision of ATS in that CTR, except in ATZs when active; and
- ICAO class G: outside controlled airspace, above FL 660, in all ATZs up to heights published in IAIP, when ATZs are active, or up to a height approved by responsible ATC unit, as well as in sporting activity areas up to heights published in IAIP, when those areas are active.

**Montenegro:**

- ICAO class C:
  - in all terminal control areas (TMA); and
  - above 10000 FT (3050 M) AMSL;
- ICAO class D: in all control zones (CTR);
- ICAO class E: between 1500 FT (450 M) AGL and 10000 FT (3050 M) AMSL except in terminal control areas (TMA) and control zones (CTR); and
- ICAO class G: from the ground up to 1500 FT (450 M) AGL, except in CTRs.

#### 2.1.3.  Free Route Airspace - General

-  For lateral and vertical limits of SECSI FRA see In-Flight of Austria, AIP Bosnia and Herzegovina, AIP Croatia, AIP Serbia/Montenegro, AIP Slovenia.
-  Time of Applicability - 24H
-  The ATS route network within Beograd FIR/UIR is withdrawn above FL 205 within all airspace portions forming SECSI FRA.
-  Within SECSI FRA, relevant significant points are considered as:
   -  FRA Horizontal Entry Point (E);
   -  FRA Horizontal Exit Point (X);
   -  FRA Intermediate Point (I);
   -  FRA Arrival Connecting Point (A); and
   -  FRA Departure Connecting Point (D),

- The Flight Level Orientation Scheme (FLOS), applicable within SECSI FRA, corresponds to the semi-circular rules according ICAO Annex 2 Appendix 3.
- Eligible flights are all flights that are intending to operate within the vertical and horizontal limits of SECSI FRA regardless of the phase of flight (overflights, arriving or departing from local aerodromes or from aerodromes situated in close proximity of SECSI FRA).
- To avoid segregated airspace volumes of TSA 11, TSA 12 and TSA 13 (airspace volume reference LYBAM11, LYBAM12 and LYBAM13) or segregated airspace volumes created with their combined activation in Beograd FIR/UIR, aircraft operators may use proposed trajectories or any other suitable FRA relevant point in direction which will keep flight planned route out from the segregated airspace.

- **TSA 11 (LYBAM11)**
  - North of line KOTUS – PARAK (included)
  - South of line VELIP – XENIT (included)
  - West of line XENIT – BGD – KOTUS (included)
- **TSA 12 (LYBAM12)**
  - North of line DIRER – BGD (included)
  - South of line ANASA – IDABO (included)

- **TSA 13 (LYBAM13)**
  - North of line XENIT – VELIP (included)
  - South of line RAVAK – OBAGI – ETIDA (included)
  - West of line XENIT – RAVAK (included)

  - North of line DIRER – BGD (included)
  - South of line RAVAK – OBAGI – ETIDA (included)
  - West of line BGD – XENIT – RAVAK (included)
- **Combined TSA 11, TSA 12 and TSA 13**
  - North of line KOTUS – PARAK (included)
  - South of line RAVAK – OBAGI – ETIDA (included)
  - West of line RAVAK – XENIT – BGD – KOTUS (included)

- Within SECSI FRA, airspace users are allowed to plan user preferred trajectories using significant points or radio navigation aids, as well as geographical coordinates under special conditions and rules laid down in AIP and RAD. Eligible flights shall flight plan via FRA relevant points according to the table below.

| **From**                           | **To**                           | **Remark**                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **FRA Horizontal Entry Point (E)** | FRA Horizontal Exit Point (X)    | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |
| **FRA Horizontal Entry Point (E)** | FRA Arrival Connecting Point (A) | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |
| **FRA Horizontal Entry Point (E)** | FRA Intermediate Point (I)       | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |
| FRA Departure Connecting Point (D) | FRA Horizontal Exit Point (X)    | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |
| FRA Departure Connecting Point (D) | FRA Arrival Connecting Point (A) | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |
| FRA Departure Connecting Point (D) | FRA Intermediate Point (I)       | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |
| **FRA Intermediate Point (I)**     | FRA Horizontal Exit Point (X)    | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |
| **FRA Intermediate Point (I)**     | FRA Arrival Connecting Point (A) | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |
| **FRA Intermediate Point (I)**     | FRA Intermediate Point (I)       | Flight plan direct or via one or several intermediate points. |

- In SECSI FRA there is no limitation on the number of FRA Intermediate Points (I) and DCTs used in Field 15 of FPL. Within SECSI FRA there is no limitation on the maximum DCT distance. In case published FRA Intermediate Points (I) or DCT segments are compulsory due ATS operational reasons, specific rules for the correct usage are described in the respective RAD. This is valid for departing, arriving and overflying traffic.

- Flights shall not be planned closer than 3 NM to the published SECSI FRA border.

- Inside SECSI FRA, the crossing of FIR borders as well as the crossing of the Area of Responsibility (AoR) boundary between the involved ATS units is basically allowed without the usage of FRA Intermediate Points (I) published along the boundaries, except when otherwise specified in RAD.

- Except for DCT segments published in RAD Appendix 4, ATS Routes and SIDs/STARs:

  - entry to and exit from SECSI FRA shall be planned using the published FRA Horizontal Entry (E) and FRA Horizontal Exit (X) Points only;
  - the planning of DCT segments that are partially outside the lateral limits of SECSI FRA (re-entry segments) is only allowed by using FRA Horizontal Entry (E) and FRA Horizontal Exit (X) Points.

- Overflying traffic are all flights whose aerodromes of departure and destination are located outside SECSI FRA. Overflying traffic may be planned directly from any FRA Horizontal Entry Point (E) to any FRA Horizontal Exit Point (X) and via published and unpublished FRA Intermediate Points (I) as specified in the AIPs of the States involved in SECSI FRA and RAD.

- Additionally, in Beograd FIR/UIR, for traffic departing or arriving from the aerodromes in the close proximity of SECSI FRA border, vertical transition to or from SECSI FRA airspace will be allowed over adequate FRA Horizontal Entry (E) or FRA Horizontal Exit (X) Points. The list of points and corresponding aerodromes are given in the table below:
