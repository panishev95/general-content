#### 2.3.1. Coordinate system

- All published geographical coordinates indicating latitude and longitude are expressed in terms of the World Geodetic System–1984 (WGS-84) geodetic reference datum.


#### 2.3.2. Time system

- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and the Gregorian calendar is used by air navigation services and in publications issued by the Aeronautical Information Service (AIS). Reporting of time is expressed to the nearest minute.
- In the AIP and associated publications, the expression “summer period” will indicate that part of the year in which “daylight saving time” is in force. The other part of the year will be named the “winter period”.
- Times applicable during the “summer period” are given in brackets.
- In Serbia and in Montenegro, the local time is the Central European Time, i.e. one hour in advance of UTC (UTC + 1 hour).
- Summer time commences on the last Sunday in March of each year at 0100 UTC. Clocks will be then put forward one hour, so that time at 0200 (0100 UTC) will be read as 0300 (0100 UTC).
- Summer time ends on the last Sunday in October of each year at 0100 UTC. Clocks will be then put backward one hour, so that time at 0300 (0100 UTC) will be read as 0200 (0100 UTC).
