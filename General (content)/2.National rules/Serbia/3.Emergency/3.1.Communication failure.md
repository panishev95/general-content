### **3.1. Communication failure**

|            Case             | Emergency frequency |
| :-------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Radio communication failure |      121,5 MHz      |

#### 3.1.1. Important information

- As soon as it is known that two-way communication has failed, ATC shall maintain separation between the aircraft having the communication failure and other aircraft based on the assumption that the aircraft will operate in accordance with items for VMC and IMC below.

**Visual meteorological conditions (VMC)**

- Except as provided for in item for IMC below, flight in controlled airspace experiencing communication failure in VMC shall:
  - set transponder to Code 7600;
  - continue to fly in VMC;
  - land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; and
  - report its arrival time by the most expeditious means to the appropriate ATS unit.

**Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC)**

- IFR flight in controlled airspace, experiencing communication failure in IMC, or where it does not appear feasible to continue in accordance with VMC procedures above shall:

a) set transponder to Code 7600;

b) maintain for a period of 7 minutes the last assigned speed and level or the minimum flight altitude, if the minimum flight altitude is higher than the last assigned level. The period of 7 minutes commences:

1. if operating on a route without compulsory reporting points or if instructions have been received to omit position reports

- at the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached, or
- at the time the transponder is set to Code 7600,

whichever is later, or

2. if operating on a route with compulsory reporting points and no instruction to omit position reports has been received:

- at the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached, or
- at the previously reported pilot estimate for the compulsory reporting point, or
- at the time of a failed report of position over a compulsory reporting point,

whichever is later.

***Note:*** The period of 7 minutes is to allow the necessary air traffic control and coordination measures.

c) thereafter, adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan;

***Note:*** With regard to changes to levels and speed, the filed flight plan, which is the flight plan as filed with an ATS unit by the pilot or a designated representative without any subsequent changes, will be used.

d) if being radar vectored or proceeding offset according to RNAV without a specified limit, proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin the current flight plan route no later than the next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude;

***Note:*** With regard to the route to be flown or the time to begin descent to the arrival aerodrome, the current flight plan, which is the flight plan, including changes, if any, brought about by subsequent clearances, will be used.

e) proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid serving the destination aerodrome and, when required to ensure compliance with item f), hold over this aid until commencement of descent;

f) commence descent from the navigation aid specified in item e) at, or as close as possible to, the expected approach time last received and acknowledged or, if no expected approach time has been received and acknowledged, at, or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan;

g) complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid; and

h) land, if possible, within thirty minutes after the estimated time of arrival specified in item f) or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later.

***Note:*** Pilots are reminded that the aircraft may not be in an area of secondary surveillance radar coverage.
