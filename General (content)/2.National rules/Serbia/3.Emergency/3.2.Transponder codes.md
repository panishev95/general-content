#### 3.2.1. Unlawful interference

- If an aircraft is subject to unlawful interference, the crew shall, if possible, notify the appropriate ATS unit of this fact, any significant circumstances associated therewith and any deviation from the current flight plan necessitated by the circumstances, in order to enable the ATS unit to give priority to the aircraft and to minimize the possibility of conflict with other aircraft.
- If possible, the pilot-in-command shall immediately by radiocommunication link notify the appropriate ATS unit on the call-sign, current position of the aircraft and his future intentions.

- If existing circumstances do not allow notification of appropriate ATS unit on unlawful interference, the pilot-in-command shall turn the transponder to mode “A” code 7500 and “IDENT” button, which means: “I have been hijacked and forced to the new destination”, if aircraft is positioned within the coverage area of the automated radar system.
- An appropriate ATS unit shall immediately by radio-communication link check if an activation of the transponder on specific code was intentional or non-intentional and to provide assistance to the aircraft.
