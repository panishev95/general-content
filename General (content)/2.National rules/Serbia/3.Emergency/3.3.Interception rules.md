### 3.3. **Interception rules**

- The pilot-in-command of the intercepted aircraft shall immediately:
  1. follow the instructions given by the intercepting aircraft, interpreting and responding to the visual signals listed under item 3.3.1;
  2. keep competent air traffic control unit fully informed of the actions undertaken in accordance with requests and instructions given by the intercepting aircraft;
  3. if radio contact with competent air traffic control unit cannot be established on the operating frequency, use the emergency frequency 121.500 MHZ and if no contact has been established and if practicable, repeat this call on the emergency frequency 243.000 MHZ;
  4. if radio contact with competent air traffic control unit from item 3) cannot be established and, if aircraft is equipped with SSR transponder, select Mode A, code 7700.

#### 3.3.1 Signals for use in the event of interception

##### Signals initiated by intercepting aircraft and responses by intercepted aircraft

| **INTERCEPTING Aircraft Signals**                            | **Meaning**                           | **INTERCEPTED Aircraft Responds**                            | **Meaning**              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| DAY or NIGHT – Rocking aircraft and flashing navigational lights at irregular intervals (and landing lights in the case of a helicopter) from a position slightly above and ahead of, and normally to the left of, the intercepted aircraft (or to the right if the intercepted aircraft is a helicopter) and, after acknowledgement, a slow level turn, normally to the left (or to the right in the case of a helicopter) on the desired heading.<br/>Note 1<br/>Meteorological conditions or terrain may require the intercepting aircraft to reverse the positions and direction of turn given above in Series 1.<br/>Note 2<br/>If the intercepted aircraft is not able to keep pace with the intercepting aircraft, the latter is expected to fly a series of race-track patterns and to rock the aircraft each time it passes the intercepted aircraft. | You have been intercepted. Follow me. | DAY or NIGHT – Rocking aircraft, flashing navigational lights at irregular intervals and following | Understood, will comply. |
| DAY or NIGHT – An abrupt breakaway manoeuvre from the intercepted aircraft consisting of a climbing turn of 90 degrees or more without crossing the line of flight of the intercepted aircraft. | You may proceed.                      | DAY or NIGHT – Rocking the aircraft.                         | Understood, will comply. |
| DAY or NIGHT – Lowering landing gear (if fitted), showing steady landing lights and overflying runway in use or, if the intercepted aircraft is a helicopter, overflying the helicopter landing area. In the case of helicopters, the intercepting helicopter makes a landing approach, coming to hover near to the landing area. | Land at this aerodrome.               | DAY or NIGHT – Lowering landing gear (if fitted), showing steady landing lights and following the intercepting aircraft and, if, after overflying the runway in use or helicopter landing area, landing is considered safe, proceeding to land. | Understood, will comply. |

##### Signals initiated by intercepted aircraft and responses by intercepting aircraft

| **INTERCEPTED Aircraft Signals**                             | **Meaning**                                  | **INTERCEPTING Aircraft Responds**                           | **Meaning**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| DAY or NIGHT – Raising landing gear (if fitted) and flashing landing lights while passing over runway in use or helicopter landing area at a height exceeding 300 M (1 000 FT) but not exceeding 600 M (2 000 FT) (in the case of a helicopter, at a height exceeding 50 M (170 FT) but not exceeding 100 M (330 FT)) above the aerodrome level, and continuing to circle runway in use or helicopter landing area. If unable to flash landing lights, flash any other lights available. | Aerodrome you have designated is inadequate. | DAY or NIGHT – If it is desired that the intercepted aircraft follow the intercepting aircraft to an alternate aerodrome, the intercepting aircraft raises its landing gear (if fitted) and uses the Series 1 signals prescribed for intercepting aircraft. If it is decided to release the intercepted aircraft, the intercepting aircraft uses the Series 2 signals prescribed for intercepting aircraft. | Understood, follow me. Understood, you may proceed. |
| DAY or NIGHT – Regular switching on and off of all available lights but in such a manner as to be distinct from flashing lights. | Cannot comply.                               | DAY or NIGHT – Use Series 2 signals prescribed for intercepting aircraft. | Understood.                                         |
| DAY or NIGHT – Irregular flashing of all available lights.   | In distress.                                 | DAY or NIGHT – Use Series 2 signals prescribed for intercepting aircraft. | Understood.                                         |
