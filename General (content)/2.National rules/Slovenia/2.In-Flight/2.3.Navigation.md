#### 2.3.1. Coordinate system

- All published coordinates indicating latitude and longitude are expressed in terms of the World Geodetic System-1984 (WGS-84) geodetic reference datum.
- The area of application for the published geographical coordinates coincides with the area of responsibility of the Aeronautical Information Service, i.e. the entire territory of the Republic of Slovenia (LJUBLJANA Flight Information Region).
- An asterisk (*) is used to identify those coordinates which are not expressed in terms of the WGS-84.

#### 2.3.2. Time System

- Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) is used in Air Traffic and Communication Services and in documents published by the Aeronautical Information Service (AIS), unless otherwise mentioned. Midnight is designated as 24:00 for the end of the day and 00:00 for the beginning of the day. In reporting time, the nearest full minute is used. Time checks to aircraft are accurate within 1 second. Times between brackets are the times during the Summer time period.
- The Local time in Slovenia is the "local mean time" (LMT = UTC + 1 HR). The Local time in Slovenia during the Summertime period is (LMT = UTC + 2 HR). The Summer time period will commence at the last Sunday of March at 01:00 UTC and cease on the last Sunday of October at 01:00 UTC.
