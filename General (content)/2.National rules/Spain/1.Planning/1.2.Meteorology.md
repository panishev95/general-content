#### 1.2.1 Important information

- At Spanish airports, there are visual displays in control towers and other aerodrome units which provide local meteorological information about: wind, runway visual range (RVR), height of cloud base, temperature and dew-point, QFE, QNH, and METAR in force.
- At some Spanish airports there is an automatic terminal information service (ATIS) which broadcasts aerodrome meteorological information including icing, turbulence and wind shear, in English, for take-off and landing of aircraft.
- Wind shear observed warnings are not issued according to the template. Forecasted wind shear warnings are only issued at some airports. (Observed wind shear warnings are those issued by aircraft and included in the additional information group of the METAR).
