| FL290 - FL410 |  A, B, C, D, G   |

#### 2.1.1. RVSM airspace

- RVSM shall be applicable in that volume of airspace between FL 290 and FL 410 inclusive in the Bangkok FIR.

- Before entering RVSM airspace, the pilot should review the status of required equipment. The following equipment should be operating normally:
  - two primary altimetry systems. A cross-check between the primary altimeters should be made. A minimum of two will need to agree within ±60m (±200FT). Failure to meet this condition will require that the altimetry system be reported as defective and air traffic control (ATC) notified;
  - one automatic altitude-keeping device;
  - one altitude-alerting device; and
  - one altitude operating transponder

- The controller-pilot phraseologies used for in-flight RVSM operations are specified in ICAO PANS-ATM Doc 4444 (Chapter 12), as shown in the following table:

  | **Message**                                                  | **Phraseology**                                              |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | For a controller to ascertain the RVSM approval status of an aircraft | (call sign) **CONFIRM RVSM APPROVED**                        |
  | For a pilot to report RVSM approval status                   | **AFFIRM RVSM**                                              |
  | For a pilot to report non-RVSM approval status:<br/><br/>on the initial call on any frequency within the RVSM airspace (controllers shall provide and readback with this same phrase), and<br/><br/>in all requests for flight level changes pertaining to flight levels within the RVSM airspace; and<br/><br/>in all read-backs to flight level clearances pertaining to flight levels within the RVSM airspace<br/><br/>Additionally, except for State aircraft, pilot shall include this phrase to read back flight level clearances involving the vertical transit through FL 290 or FL 410 | **NEGATIVE RVSM**                                            |
  | For a pilot of a non-RVSM approved State aircraft to report non-RVSM approval status, in response to the phrase (call sign) **CONFIRM RVSM APPROVED**. | **NEGATIVE RVSM STATE AIRCRAFT**                             |
  | For a controller to deny of clearance into the RVSM airspace | (call sign) **UNABLE CLEARANCE INTO RVSM AIRSPACE, MAINTAIN [or DESCEND TO, or CLIMB TO] FLIGHT LEVEL** (number) |
  | For a pilot to report when severe turbulence affects the aircraft’s capability to maintain the height-keeping requirements for RVSM. | **UNABLE RVSM DUE TURBULENCE**                               |
  | For a pilot to report that the aircraft’s equipment has degraded en-route below that required for flight within the RVSM airspace. (See Appendix A)<br/><br/>(This phrase is to be used to convey both the initial indication of the non-MASPS compliance, and henceforth, on initial contact on all frequencies within the lateral limits of the RVSM airspace until such time as the problem ceases to exist, or the aircraft has exited the RVSM airspace.) | **UNABLE RVSM DUE EQUIPMENT**                                |
  | For a controller to request an aircraft to provide information as soon as RVSM-approved status has been regained or the pilot is ready to resume RVSM operations | **REPORT WHEN ABLE TO RESUME RVSM**                          |
  | For a controller to request confirmation that an aircraft has regained RVSM-approved status or a pilot is ready to resume RVSM operations | CONFIRM ABLE **TO RESUME RVSM**                              |
  | For a pilot to report the ability to resume operations within the RVSM airspace after an equipment or weather-related contingency. | **READY TO RESUME RVSM**                                     |

- The pilot must notify ATC when the aircraft’s equipment has degraded below the requirement in item above.

  - When informed by the pilot of an RVSM-approved aircraft operating in RVSM airspace that the aircraft’s equipment no longer meets the RVSM requirements, ATC shall consider the aircraft as non-RVSM-approved.

  - The pilot shall inform ATC, as soon as practicable, of any restoration of the proper functioning of equipment required to meet the RVSM requirements.

  - The first ACC to become aware of a change in an aircraft’s RVSM status shall coordinate with adjacent ACCs, as appropriate.

    **Scenario 1:** All automatic altitude control systems fail (e.g., Automatic Altitude Hold).

  |                     **The Pilot should**                     |                  **ATC can be expected to**                  |
  | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
  | **Initially**, maintain CFL and evaluate the aircraft’s capability to maintain altitude through manual control. |                                                              |
  | **Subsequently**, watch for conflicting traffic both visually and by reference to ACAS, if equipped. |                                                              |
  | If considered necessary, alert nearby aircraft by<br/>Making maximum use of exterior lights;<br/>Broadcasting position, FL, and intentions on 121.5 MHz (as a back-up, the VHF inter-pilot air-to-air frequency, 123.45 MHz, may be used.) |                                                              |
  | Notify ATC of the failure and intended course of action. Possible courses of action include | Obtain pilot’s intentions, and pass essential traffic information. |
  | Maintaining the CFL and route, provided that the aircraft can maintain level.<br/>Requesting ATC clearance to climb above or descend below RVSM airspace if the aircraft cannot maintain CFL and ATC cannot establish lateral, longitudinal or conventional vertical separation.<br/>Executing the contingency manoeuvre, if ATC clearance cannot be obtained and the aircraft cannot maintain CFL. | If the pilot intends to continue in RVSM airspace, assess traffic situation to determine if the aircraft can be accommodated through the provision of lateral, longitudinal, or conventional vertical separation, and if so, apply the appropriate minimum<br/>If the pilot requests clearance to exit RVSM airspace, accommodate expeditiously, if possible.<br/>If adequate separation cannot be established and it is not possible to comply with the pilot’s request for clearance to exit RVSM airspace, advise the pilot of essential traffic information, notify other aircraft in the vicinity and continue to monitor the situation.<br/>Notify adjoining ATC facilities/sectors of the situation. |

  **Scenario 2:** Loss of redundancy in primary altimetry systems

  | **The Pilot should**                                         | **ATC can be expected to**                                  |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | If the remaining altimetry system is functioning normally, couple that system to the automatic altitude control system, notify ATC of the loss of redundancy and maintain vigilance of altitude keeping. | Acknowledge the situation and continue to monitor progress. |

  **Scenario 3:** All primary altimetry systems are considered unreliable or fail

  | **The Pilot should**                                         | **ATC can be expected to**                                   |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Maintain CFL by reference to the standby altimeter (if the aircraft is so equipped). |                                                              |
  | Alert nearby aircraft by<br/><br/>Making maximum use of exterior lights;<br/><br/>Broadcasting position, FL, and intentions on 121.5 MHz (as a back-up, the VHF inter-pilot air-to-air frequency, 123.45 MHz, may be used.) |                                                              |
  | Consider declaring an emergency. Notify ATC of the failure and intended course of action. Possible courses of action include: | Obtain pilot’s intentions, and pass essential traffic information. |
  | Maintaining CFL and route, provided that ATC can provide lateral, longitudinal or conventional vertical separation.<br/><br/>Requesting ATC clearance to climb above or descend below RVSM airspace if ATC cannot establish adequate separation from other aircraft.<br/><br/>Executing the contingency manoeuvre shown in 9.4, if ATC clearance cannot be obtained. | If the pilot intends to continue in RVSM airspace, assess traffic situation to determine if the aircraft can be accommodated through the provision of lateral, longitudinal, or conventional vertical separation, and if so, apply the appropriate minimum.<br/><br/>If the pilot requests clearance to exit RVSM airspace, accommodate expeditiously, if possible.<br/><br/>If adequate separation cannot be established and it is not possible to comply with the pilot’s request for clearance to exit RVSM airspace, advise the pilot of essential traffic information, notify other aircraft in the vicinity and continue to monitor the situation.<br/><br/>Notify adjoining ATC facilities/sectors of the situation. |

  **Scenario 4:** The primary altimeters diverge by more than 200 FT (60 m)

  | **The Pilot should**                                         |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Determine the defective system through the normal airplane integrated comparator warning system or in the absence of such a system, establish trouble-shooting procedures comparing the primary altimeters to the standby altimeter (corrected using the correction card) |
  | If the defective system can be determined, couple the functioning altimeter to the altitude keeping device in use. |
  | If the defective system cannot be determined, follow the guidance in Scenario 3 for failure or unreliable altimeter indications of all primary altimeters |

  **When the aircraft encounters severe turbulence:**

  Forecast

  1. When a meteorological forecast is predicting severe turbulence, ATC shall determine whether RVSM should be suspended and, if so, for how long and for which specific flight level(s) and/or area.
  2. In cases where RVSM will be suspended, the ACC suspending RVSM shall coordinate with adjacent ACCs with regard to the flight levels appropriate for the transfer of traffic; unless a contingency flight level allocation scheme has been determined by letter of agreement. The ACC suspending RVSM shall also coordinate applicable sector capabilities with adjacent ACCs as appropriate.

  Not forecast

  1. When an aircraft operating in RVSM airspace encounters severe turbulence due to weather or wake vortex that the pilot believes will impact the aircraft’s capability to maintain its cleared flight level, the pilot shall inform ATC. ATC shall establish either an appropriate horizontal separation or an increased minimum vertical separation.
  2. ATC shall, to the extent possible, accommodate pilot requests for flight level and/or route changes and shall pass on traffic information as required.
  3. ATC shall solicit reports from other aircraft to determine whether RVSM should be suspended entirely or within a specific flight level band and/or area.
  4. ACC suspending RVSM shall coordinate such suspension(s) with, and any required adjustments to, sector capabilities with adjacent ACCs, as appropriate, to ensure an orderly progression to the transfer of traffic.

  **Scenario 5:** Turbulence (greater than moderate), which the pilot believes, will impact the aircraft’s capability to maintain flight level.

  | **The Pilot should**                                         | **ATC can be expected to**                                   |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Watch for conflicting traffic both visually and by reference to ACAS, if equipped. |                                                              |
  | If considered necessary, alert nearby aircraft by<br/><br/>Making maximum use of exterior lights;<br/><br/>Broadcasting position, FL, and intentions on 121.5 MHz (as a back-up, the VHF inter-pilot air-to-air frequency, 123.45 MHz, may be used.) |                                                              |
  | Notify ATC of intended course of action as soon as possible. Possible courses of action include: |                                                              |
  | Maintaining CFL and route, provided that ATC can provide lateral, longitudinal or conventional vertical separation.<br/><br/>Requesting flight level change, if necessary.<br/><br/>Executing the contingency manoeuvre shown in 9.4, if ATC clearance cannot be obtained and the aircraft cannot maintain CFL. | Assess traffic situation to determine if the aircraft can be accommodated through the provision of lateral, longitudinal, or conventional vertical separation, and if so, apply the appropriate minimum.<br/><br/>If unable to provide adequate separation, advise the pilot of essential traffic information and request pilot’s intentions.<br/><br/>Notify other aircraft in the vicinity and continue to monitor the situation.<br/><br/>Notify adjoining ATC facilities/sectors of the situation. |

- Air traffic services will consider suspending RVSM procedures within affected areas of the Bangkok FIR when there are pilot reports of greater than moderate turbulence. Within areas where RVSM procedures are suspended, the vertical separation minimum between all aircraft will be 2 000 FT.
