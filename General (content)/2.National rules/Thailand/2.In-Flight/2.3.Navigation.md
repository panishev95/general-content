#### 2.3.1. Coordinate system

- All published geographical coordinates in the Bangkok FIR indicating latitude and longitude are expressed in terms of the World Geodetic System-1984 (WGS-84) geodetic reference datum.
- The area of application for the published geographical coordinates coincides with the area of responsibility of the Aeronautical Information Services, i.e. the entire territory of Thailand as well as the airspace over the high seas encompassed by the Bangkok Flight Information Region in accordance with the Regional Air Navigation Agreement.
- Aerodromes with coordinates which have been transformed into WGS-84 coordinates but whose accuracy does not meet the requirements in Appendix 1. Aeronautical Data Catalogue in Doc 10066 PANS-AIM, are listed below:
  - VTUN — Nakhon Ratchasima / Khorat
  - VTSN — Nakhon Si Thammarat / Cha - Ian

#### 2.3.2. Temporal reference system

Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) is used in the air traffic and communication services and in documents published by the Aeronautical Information Services. When reporting time, the nearest full minute is used, e.g., 12 hr 40 min 40 sec is reported as 1241. Time checks to aircraft are accurate within 30 sec.
