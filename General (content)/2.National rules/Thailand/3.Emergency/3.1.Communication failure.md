### **3.1. Communication failure**

| Radio communication failure |      121,5 MHz      |

#### 3.1.1. Important information

- If two-way communication is lost with an aircraft, the radar controller should first determine whether or not the aircraft’s receiver is functioning by instructing the aircraft on frequency so far used to acknowledge by making a specified manoeuvre and by observing the aircraft’s track or by instructing the aircraft to operate the Special Position Identification (SPI) feature or to make the code changes. Where it has been established by the action mentioned above that the aircraft’s radio receiver is functioning, the radar controller will continue to provide radar services to the aircraft.
- If the aircraft’s radio is completely unserviceable, the pilot should carry out the procedures for radio failure in accordance with ICAO provisions. If radar identification has already been established, the radar controller will vector other identified aircraft clear of its track until such time as the aircraft leaves radar cover.
- In the event of an aircraft radio receiver failure, a pilot shall select mode A/3 code 7600 and follow established procedures; subsequent control of the aircraft will be based on those procedures.
