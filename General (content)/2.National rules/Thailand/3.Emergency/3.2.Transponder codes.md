### **3.2. Emergency transponder codes**

|            Case             | SSR transponder code |
| :-------------------------: | :------------------: |
|          Emergency          |   Mode A/3 - 7700    |
| Radio communication failure |   Mode A/3 - 7600    |
|    Unlawful interference    |   Mode A/3 - 7500    |

#### 3.2.1 Unlawful interference

- Should an aircraft in flight be subjected to unlawful interference, the pilot shall endeavour to set the transponder to modeA/3 code 75 (or 7500) to give indication of the situation unless circumstances warrant the use of mode A/3 code 77 (or 7700).

- When a pilot has selected Mode A/3 code 7500 and is subsequently requested to confirm his code by ATC he shall, according to circumstance either confirm or not reply at all. 

  **Note: **The absence of a reply from the pilot will be taken by ATC as an indication that the use of mode A/3 code 7500 is not due to an inadvertent false code selection*
