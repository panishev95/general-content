### 1.1. Measuring system

| For measurment of                                            | Units of measurement                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Distance used in navigation position reporting               | kilometers, nautical miles                                   |
| Relatively short distances such as those relating to aerodromes | kilometres, metres                                           |
| Elevations, heights                                          | metres, feet                                                 |
| Flight speed (indicated, true, ground)                       | kilometres per hour, knots, Mach number                      |
| Wind speed at flight level (altitude)                        | kilometres per hour, knots                                   |
| Surface wind speed                                           | metres per second                                            |
| Vertical speed                                               | metres per second, feet per minute                           |
| Wind direction for landing and take-off                      | True. At aerodromes with magnetic variation of 5Â° and more a magnetic variation correction is introduced |
| Visibility                                                   | kilometres, metres                                           |
| Runway visual range                                          | metres                                                       |
| Altimeter setting                                            | hectopascals, mm Hg, millibars                               |
| Temperature                                                  | degrees Celsius                                              |
| Mass                                                         | kilogrammes, tons                                            |
| Time                                                         | hours, minutes with the day of 24 hours beginning at midnight as per Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) |
