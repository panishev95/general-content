#### 2.5.1. Low visibility procedures

The Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) are applied at aerodromes for safety provision of CAT II, III operations and take-off in low visibility conditions. 

ATS unit shall implement provisions (service procedures in low visibility conditions) concerning the start and continuation of CAT II/III operations and also departures under RVR below 550 m.

Categories of precision approach and landing operations: 

- Category I (CAT I) operation – A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height not lower than 60 m and with either a visibility not less than 800 m or a runway visual range not less than 550 m. 
- Category II (CAT II) operation - A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height lower than 60 m, but not lower than 30 m, and a runway visual range not less than 300 m. 
- Category IIIA (CAT IIIA) operation - A precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height lower than 30 m or no decision height, and a runway visual range not less than 175 m. 

#### 2.5.2. Breaking action

- If the braking action is less than 0.3, flights of aircraft with a gas turbine engine are prohibited. 
- Take-off and landing of aircraft on the RWY is prohibited in the presence on the surface of the dry coating of freshly fallen snow thickness more than 50 mm, more slush -12mm and water more-10mm

 **Note:** The value of the normative friction coefficient of 0.3 corresponds to the value of the measured friction coefficient of 0.17.

**Table of measured friction and normative friction correlation**

| Measured friction coefficient by SFT | 0.15 | 0.2  | 0.25 | 0.3  | 0.35 | 0.4  | 0.45 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Normative friction coefficient       | 0.29 | 0.32 | 0.34 | 0.37 | 0.39 | 0.42 | 0.45 |

- The information on braking action for each third of the runway starting with the runway end are given as a code number (column 1 of the table below).
- The relation between the values of code numbers, the values  of  measured  friction  coefficients,  the  values  of  the normative friction coefficients, the estimated surface friction and the operational values are given in the following table:
