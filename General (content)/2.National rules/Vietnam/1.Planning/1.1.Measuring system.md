| Distance used in navigation, position reporting, etc...      | Kilometres or Nautical miles                 |
| Relatively short distances such as those relating to aerodromes (e.g. Runway lengths) | Metres                                       |
| Altitudes, elevations and heights                            | Metres or feet                               |
| Horizontal speed including wind speed                        | Metre per second or metre per knots          |
| Vertical speed                                               | Metre per second                             |
