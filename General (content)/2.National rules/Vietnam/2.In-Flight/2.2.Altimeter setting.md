### 	2.2. Altimeter setting

The altimeter setting procedures in use generally conform to those contained in ICAO Doc 8168, Vol I, Part 6 and some are given in below

|           Position           | Altimeter pressure  |      Altitude report      |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Below transition level    | QNH, QFE on request |       Feet, metres        |
| At or above transition level |   QNE (Standard)    | Flight Level (FL), metres |

Transition altitudes for all aerodromes are given on the instrument approach charts

#### 2.2.1. Important information

QNH reports and temperature information for use in determining adequate terrain clearance are provided in MET broadcasts and are available on request from air traffic service units. QNH values are given in hectopascal (hPa). 

A QNH altimeter setting is made available to aircraft in taxi clearance prior to take-off.

At all times, ATC units have available of transmission to aircraft in flight, on request, the information required to determine the lowest flight level which will ensure adequate terrain clearance for routes or segments of routes on which this information is required.

A QNH altimeter setting is made available in approach clearances and in clearances to enter the traffic circuit.

A QFE altimeter setting, clearly identified as such will be provided in approach and landing clearances on request.

#### 2.2.2 Altimeter setting regions

The altimeter setting regions are Noi Bai, Da Nang and Tan Son Nhat.
