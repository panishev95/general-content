#### 2.3.1. Coordinate system

All published geographical co-ordinates indicating latitude and longitude are expressed in terms of the World Geodetic System - 1984 (WGS-84) geodetic reference datum.

The area of application for the published geographical co-ordinates coincides with the area of responsibility of the Aeronautical Information Service, i.e. the entire territory of Viet Nam as well as the airspace over the seas encompassed by Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh flight information regions.

#### 2.3.3. Temporal reference system

Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) is used by air navigation services and in publications issued by the Aeronautical Information Service. Reporting of time is expressed to the nearest minute e.g. 12:40:35 is reported as 1241. Local time in Viet Nam is 7 hours ahead of UTC. Time checks to aircraft are accurate within 30 seconds.
