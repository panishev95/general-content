### **3.2. Emergency transponder codes**

|            Case             | SSR transponder code |
| :-------------------------: | :------------------: |
|          Emergency          |    Mode A - 7700     |
| Radio communication failure |    Mode A - 7600     |
|    Unlawful interference    |    Mode A - 7500     |

When a pilot has selected Mode A/3 code 7500 and is subsequently requested to confirm his code by ATC he shall, according to circumstance either confirm or not reply at all. The absence of a reply from the pilot will be taken by ATC as an indication that the use of code 7500 is not due to an inadvertent false code selection.
